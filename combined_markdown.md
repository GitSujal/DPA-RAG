**Data Analyst Roadmap-20230916\_013719-Meeting Recording**

This is the video transcript from that event where the founder and instructor of data profession academy "Sujal Dhungana" talks about the upcoming session in September 2023 and how data profession academy helps the student start their data journey. In this video he talks about road map of becoming a data analyst.

4:35
 Morning.

4:50
 Just waiting for a few more people to join.

5:55
 Hey morning everyone.

6:03
 We're just giving a few minutes to other people to join.

6:06
 Sorry about the delay.

7:10
 Get 2-2 more minutes and then we'll start.

7:28
 Hi, Alice.

7:30
 If you're trying to say something, it's not audible.

7:55
 OK, I guess we can start and if people join in between then yeah we will maybe like introduce them in between as well.

8:04
 So thanks everyone for joining the session.

8:08
 I am Sujat Dhamana and founder instructor at the Professional Academy and today I'm I'm hosting this webinar to give out step by step strategy on how you can start your data endless journey.

8:23
 So starting to become a data endless is is a daunting journey.

8:27
 There are multiple steps in here, there are multiple tools that you need to learn.

8:31
 There are multiple languages that you need to learn and actually I will try to make it a bit easier for you and then layout the plan so that you can follow that step by step process and become data and this if that's what you're interested in.

8:47
 So thank you so much for attending this this morning.

8:52
 So let's get started on this.

8:56
 So first like any any any event we would like to start with an icebreaker and in in today's agenda there will be.

9:06
 So first is the this icebreaker activity, then we will go into the step by step guide on the data endless road map and then at the end we will have a live data project demo and in that in that demo you would see how a data project is performed end to end from problem to the solution stage and so so let's get let's get right into it.

9:31
 So in the aspect version, I would like everyone if possible, can you introduce yourself maybe and maybe say a few sentences about you?

9:39
 And as as breaker activity, can you tell us that if you are a sour thinker, sour thinker, a sour thinker is someone who takes really long time in sour and then think about all their life in sour.

9:50
 So yeah, if you are comfortable sharing that, that would be great.

9:54
 So I can go first.

9:55
 So hi, I'm Suzanne, as I've already introduced myself and I'm the founder with Data Professional Academy and in my current role I'm a senior data engineer with Water Corporation and and in in in terms of sour thinker, yes, I'm a sour thinker.

10:11
 So especially in cold days, I like to turn turn this hour, turn the hot water on and then stay there for a while and yeah, think think about my life and everything.

10:22
 So yeah, if anyone's comfortable going next, maybe more.

10:26
 So you want to go next and see a bit about you.

10:43
 Hello.

10:45
 Can you still hear us?

10:51
 Okay.

10:52
 It looks like it's having audio issues.

10:55
 Maybe Nisa, if you wanna go next.

10:58
 If you Yeah, she's wanting to be sorry.

11:03
 My baby.

11:04
 My name is and I spoke to Australia in 2019 and I was in 1921 and then I moved to church in 2021 and I started working in age here, so after that.

11:25
 So I want to change my after that.

11:28
 And I think I have a lot of interest in data.

11:34
 So I'm joining this task for that.

11:37
 Usually I'm going to shower things of these guys because I want to shower with it 5 minutes.

11:46
 So yeah, I can't to shower anything.

11:49
 So yeah.

11:50
 Thank you so much.

11:52
 Yeah.

11:52
 Yeah.

11:53
 Thanks for sharing.

11:54
 And Binoli, if you wanna introduce yourself.

12:00
 Sure.

12:01
 Hi I'm just to start with I'm not a sharper thinker.

12:05
 I I pretty much in a rush and just to get things lot of things going on in my head so just get on with the task.

12:12
 Yeah I'm trying to attend this like I'm I'm hoping to learn something for the data analyst.

12:17
 I'm from the healthcare professions, so I want to analytic analysis and I these days it's load, everything is digital and there is a really big amount like high really high volume of data everywhere and we just need to know what we need to make out of it is something meaningful for everyone that's helpful and I love quality improvement so which just trying to improve the systems and processes.

12:41
 So that's why I would like to learn bit more about that analyst in professional way.

12:46
 Thanks.

12:47
 Yeah.

12:48
 All right.

12:48
 Yeah.

12:48
 Thanks so much for sharing and yeah, thanks.

12:51
 Thanks everyone for sharing.

12:52
 I guess if we get more, more participants, we will, we will give them a chance to introduce themselves as well.

12:58
 And and the reason I'm asking this one is it has got something to do with the project we we will do next.

13:03
 So yeah, let's get right into it.

13:07
 So, so the whole data Alice roadmap, I have broken down it into four step and I call it LON, you'd so and do so LON and we'll talk about its step in detail later on.

13:21
 But yeah that's really highly you can think of it as four step and then we we have we have or I have advised this step to a lot of my friends or friends of friends and yeah it has been like proven useful that yeah they are currently working as it done in this role.

13:40
 So I believe that this step works and it's up to it's up to the it's up to you as well like how how you implement that step.

13:49
 It's not like it's not that that much prescriptive anyway.

13:53
 It's just like in general guidance of what you need to and then what could be the next steps and things like that.

13:59
 So let's have a look into that.

14:04
 So the first thing you would need to do is learn the basic concept and tool and that's kind of like everyone would know this.

14:13
 So if you want to get into data analytics then you need to learn the data analytics basics.

14:18
 So what data actually is, how data needs to be stored, What is data wrangling like what is data cleaning, what is what is data analysis and basic analytics model like what is regress and what is the relate, what is the relationship between two data means.

14:33
 So all those kind of like basic concepts and basic data analytic concept you definitely need to be familiar with if you want to be a data analyst.

14:43
 And even even not, not, not, not, not not just for data analytics, not just for data analysts, but also other professions or like who work with that data analyst.

14:55
 They probably would benefit from this basic concepts as well.

15:02
 Because when they are dealing with data analytics.

15:04
 So when they are dealing with data, if they know these basic concepts then they can, they can they can make that interaction better like and like be notice it.

15:13
 I think like if you're working in like healthcare and then maybe you have got a lot of data analytics team or you work with data and team well.

15:20
 But when you when you have these concepts and maybe like a little bit of background around it then that would make your interaction better.

15:26
 Maybe that would that that would that would help you like work with those teams better.

15:32
 And that's that's why I think now it's kind of like really big thing that organizations are pushing to our data literacy, which is, which is kind of which is kind of this same thing that, OK, now we need to understand what what, what data we have, how we handle our data.

15:52
 Maybe there are like security implications like what based on the data security where we can store the data, where we cannot store the data and all those things around how we need to protect our data that also comes into this data analytics basic concepts and that is really important if you if you are data analytics then you if if you are a data analyst you definitely can't skip it.

16:16
 But even if you are not then having this having this knowledge it's really helpful because if you look at today's world everything is run by data.

16:24
 So that's that's really it's it's just fundamental to have this basic concepts around data.

16:34
 So if we deep, if you dive bit deep on this one, so it says basic conception tool as well.

16:41
 So we'll probably look into tools as well like what are the tools that the data analytics or data analysts use on day-to-day basis and what are the tools you would definitely need to learn if you want to become a data analyst.

16:56
 So, so first thing, the data wrangling, like I said.

17:00
 So data wrangling is the process of shaping or transforming your data into into a useful form, right.

17:09
 So when the data comes, when the data is collected, it's usually in really weird format or like it can be in unusable form.

17:19
 So what that wrangling process involves is that then you would need to probably clean your data.

17:24
 There can have, there can be some errors in the data, there can be some nulls, there are there can be some missing values in the data.

17:31
 You would need to then clean the data so that you can do the further analysis on it.

17:36
 And when we say cleaning, it's not that straightforward.

17:39
 So there are a lot of things and consideration that goes into the process when we do the cleaning, but those those are the kind of techniques that we need to launch so that we can we can handle our data better, right.

17:52
 And then the next thing is data analytics techniques, which I which I said like regressions or some ML models.

18:00
 And again it depends on like if you want to be a data analyst, you definitely need to know some form of statistics or some mathematics behind it.

18:12
 So if you want to show a relationship between one variable or like one item in the other, what are the kind of tests that you need to do?

18:22
 You at least need to know those kind of things, because when you're doing the analysis, most of the time you're trying to find those associations, right?

18:30
 So if we talk about the project that we did last in our last way, it was to find the relationship between 2 movies.

18:39
 And if, if we if it was something else, let's say in any industry like retail industry, you probably want to find the relationship between the supply and demand and all those kind of things, right.

18:50
 So a lot of those come from basic mathematical modeling and basic statistics.

18:57
 And that's the kind of concept you would need to launch.

19:00
 So that when you are producing the analytics, you kind of know what's happening and what are the, what are the kind of support you need to say that.

19:08
 OK.

19:08
 This one very table is related to other variables so that we we know the relationship between that.

19:14
 And if we if we can't understand the relationship between 2 variables, maybe we can use that to our benefit.

19:21
 And that's where the data analytics delivers the value to business.

19:25
 Because at the end, our goal is not to find the relationship.

19:28
 Our goal is to OK, if we can find that relationship, how can we use that so that the business can benefit, right.

19:36
 So that's the kind of thing you would definitely need to learn in the dial analytics techniques.

19:42
 And the next thing is exploratory analysis which is again like when you have a data then you need to you need to start exploring the data to find out OK, what are the common patterns that I can find or what are the common associations that I can find.

19:57
 So you can use visual techniques that give some produce some graphs and you can see that OK when this when this value is going up.

20:05
 The other value is also going up.

20:07
 So that kind of implies that there is there, there could be some association, but again in order to validate that you need to, you need to prove it statistically, right?

20:16
 So you need to produce you some numbers that says that, OK, so when the value, when value one is going up, the value 2 is also going up for sure.

20:25
 So those are the kind of exploratory analysis you would need to learn how to do.

20:30
 And then the last thing is the tools.

20:33
 So these tools are used to do all the other things that I just mentioned.

20:37
 So all the three things that we said like data wrangling, data analytics and exploratory data analysis, you would need certain tools to do that because because like because it's it's not, it's not easy to do those manually, right.

20:51
 So there are tools that are specified that that are used for specific purposes like Excel.

20:58
 So Excel is a spreadsheet tool and must must be probably would know that.

21:03
 So Excel is used for quick data analysis.

21:07
 The Excel is also used for quick visualization as well because Excel, Excel can produce charts right?

21:14
 And Excel in in certain instances is also used for data collection because people will just put their numbers in the excel and that would be your data source.

21:22
 So you will get the data from Excel and you will start your data analysis.

21:26
 So Excel is one of the most powerful and most popular tool in data analytics.

21:35
 So that that is definitely a tool that you would need to learn.

21:40
 And then the Next up is SQL, right?

21:43
 So when your data grows, or when you when you want to put a really good structure around your data, that's when the Excel will start to fail.

21:52
 Because Excel.

21:54
 In Excel you can't define the data type, you can't put certain rules around it.

21:58
 You can with some VDA and stuff, but it's not built for that purpose.

22:04
 So when you want to put really good structure around your data and then you want to put a rule against it, you want to do access control and all those things, that's when you will start to need a database, right?

22:16
 So when the data sits on a database, now in order to get access to that data like in order to read that data from the database, you will need a query language and SQL or structured query language is one of the query language that is used to get the data from the database.

22:34
 So that's that's definitely again another skill that you would need to learn because if you are a data analyst and the data lives in some database then you would need to write that SQL query to get the data out of the database so that you can start your analysis.

22:50
 So that would be the next step.

22:53
 And then the third one is a programming language, right.

22:57
 So when we, when we say that we need to do all those like data wrangling and data analytics, those steps would need to be automated, right?

23:06
 So if you are producing a report on daily basis and you're getting the data and you need to do some data cleaning and transformation, you can't, you can't rely on yourself to do it manually every day, right.

23:18
 So what would you do next is that you will automate that process using a programming language And in in the programming language you can write those instruction in specific specific manner so that it will always perform those steps when it gets the data and then it will be automated.

23:36
 So it will it will run on daily, hourly or even every second if you if you want to run it every second.

23:42
 So that's the reason we will need to learn at least one programming language and Python is one of the most popular programming language among data analysts.

23:51
 But if you have any other skills like R or anything else, that would also do the job, because at the end, at the end we're just trying to automate the process and trying to get a predictable result.

24:07
 And the last thing on the tools list is Power BI.

24:11
 So Power BI is a dashboarding tool.

24:14
 So at the end when you are building a report, the final product most probably would be like some visualizations or report that the business looks at and then the business decisions are based on that report.

24:28
 And Power BI is one of the tool that helps you build those kind of reports.

24:33
 And again like like I said for the programming language, so Power BI can give you dashboards that update on daily basis or update on whatever schedule that you want.

24:43
 And the Power BI also comes up with a lot of preset visualization, so you can just drag and drop this visualization and use it with your data.

24:54
 So and again Power BI is just one of the despotting tool.

24:57
 There are a lot of other despotting tool available in the market like Tableau and there are a lot of others.

25:04
 So you need to be, you need to be experienced with at least one of them so that you can you, you can build those dashboards and reports which the business can make their decisions.

25:15
 So, so yeah, that's that's the kind of whole 4 things that you would need to learn in the basics and tools part.

25:24
 So let's let's, I think we probably have some bit deeper dive into what each of that means.

25:32
 So data wrangling is the most important skill for a data analyst because 80% of data analyst time is spent on data data wrangling.

25:45
 So you would need to master this skill.

25:48
 There is there is no negotiation on that this one because when you get the data, the data can be wild.

25:54
 The data can have like as many errors as it can you you need to think of the worst possible situation for the data.

26:02
 But even with that worst data you would need to be able to produce your insights.

26:08
 So you are the, you are like the middle person in between between that raw wild data to a clean analysis that you're going to perform.

26:17
 And that's where you would put a lot of your thinking, a lot of a lot of business context as well because sometimes that error can come from certain business processes as well.

26:31
 So if you don't understand the business well, you probably won't be able to do this data wrangling step fully correctly.

26:39
 So it's a mix of both like mathematical or analytical skill, plus it's it's a mix of soft skill and business skill as well.

26:49
 Because let's say there is a missing data and if you don't understand the process behind capturing that data, then you won't know why that missing data is occurring there in the 1st place, right?

27:00
 So if you can find the stakeholder or if you can find the, if you can find more information about the business process that captures that data, then you would know.

27:11
 OK, so these are the reasons the the null value appears in this data.

27:17
 So after knowing this reason, this is probably how I would be able to solve this null or I will treat this null as something else because that's an useful information as well.

27:28
 So those, those are the kind of things you wouldn't need to be aware of and train yourself on how I can be better at the data wrangling, how can be, how I can be better at data wrangling.

27:44
 And yeah, that's that's that's something that you would learn by practice as well.

27:51
 So try to work on as many projects as possible, try to work with as different data types as possible.

27:58
 And then when you start seeing those differences or when you start showing those errors, then you will start also start to learn how you handle those errors.

28:09
 So, yeah, that's that's that that's that's how you would skill yourself up in this one is yeah, just try to work with as many data or as different type of data as possible.

28:22
 And if you can, try to work with different business domain as well because different business domain have got different problems with their data.

28:30
 For example, if finance, if you're working with finance data, maybe it has a different issue, if you're working with health data, maybe it has a it has got a different issue and the the way to solve those issues could be business specific as well.

28:46
 So if you work with bunch of different data then you would get like proper idea of OK, these these are the kind of issues that can that could appear in different scenarios and best based on your experience, this could be the ways to solve them.

29:05
 Okay.

29:05
 So yeah, that's on the data wrangling part.

29:08
 Let's move on to next one and feel free to ask any questions in in in between if you if you got any.

29:16
 I think Roshan has just joined if you if you are comfortable, do you want to introduce yourself to all of us?

29:32
 Hey Suzel, Good morning.

29:38
 Good morning, everyone.

29:39
 My name is Roshan Takveri.

29:41
 I'm from the port.

29:43
 So I'm just, I just wanna know about that and at least so I'm just joining this one during the session.

29:51
 Sorry for the late.

29:52
 Yeah, that sounds good.

29:55
 Yeah, that sounds like.

29:57
 Yeah, yeah.

29:58
 Thanks.

29:58
 Thanks for that.

29:59
 And we have got a icebreaker question.

30:01
 Are you a sour thinker?

30:02
 Like, do you take really long time in this hour or are you a quick or you take a quick shower?

30:10
 Sorry, Susan.

30:12
 So no, our our icebreaker question is do you take really long time taking sour or are you like you you take sour really quick?

30:20
 That that was our icebreaker question.

30:21
 Yeah.

30:22
 I think I'm doing both.

30:24
 It depends.

30:24
 Yeah.

30:26
 OK.

30:28
 Yeah.

30:28
 Yeah.

30:29
 Thank you.

30:30
 All right.

30:30
 Yeah.

30:31
 Thanks for sharing.

30:32
 So, yeah, let's, let's get into our next step.

30:36
 So after data wrangling, let's look into the data analytics technique.

30:40
 So there are a lots of.

30:42
 So when we when you're saying data analytics technique, there are heaps of it right?

30:48
 And depending on how deep you want to go into this data analytics techniques, the AI and ML models and everything that could decide what career path you want to pursue, right.

31:00
 So if you really want to get into all the nitty gritty of like machine learning models, all the nitty gritty of training those models, all the nitty gritty of all the mathematics and algorithm that goes behind it, then probably you would want to be a data scientist.

31:19
 Because data scientist is the role that focuses more on that right.

31:23
 But if you want to stay maybe a little bit on the on the surface you want to actually like use those analytical model but you probably don't want to gain to the like mathematical details or like fine tuning those models and all those kind of thing then probably data analyst is the career for you, right.

31:43
 So that's that that's that's what you can do the do, do do retrospective with you as well.

31:50
 Like what what what are the things that I enjoy, right.

31:53
 So if you if you ask me so I enjoy identifying problems with the business.

31:59
 So I love working with businesses, identifying what their problem is, and then I love searching for data that could find me a solution for that problem, right?

32:10
 And then so having said that, if that solution is like building a really complex ML model and stuff, then I probably don't want to go down that path because that will take too much of the time and I would lose my time I would spend with business talking to customer and stuff.

32:27
 That's why my preference is to be a data analyst because that allows me to like interact, interact continuously with the customer, identify new problem and then find the data to solve it.

32:40
 But if that's not what you want to do under your day-to-day life, if you don't find that interesting and if you are more into building ML models and stuff, then you can go into look into data scientists career.

32:55
 So simple data analytics tool like linear regression, clustering or market bars, basket analysis, those are kind of like really simple data analytics technique that almost all of the data analysts are supposed to know and there are some like decision trees and stuff that they are like pretty basic data analytics tool that it would just be able to use like right off the bat.

33:17
 So those are the kind of techniques you would be, you wouldn't need to familiarize yourself with.

33:22
 So if if there's a if there's a like really, really simple linear regression problem, then you should be able to just implement that on your own rather than asking your data scientist to do that.

33:33
 So you you need to be, you need to be aware of or you need to have enough knowledge on those really simple data analytics models and tools.

33:47
 So now Next up is the exploratory, Next up is exploratory data analysis.

34:00
 So exploratory data analysis can be both visual and non visual.

34:04
 So when you get the data then you can like quickly produce some graphs to see OK what, what, what sort of association or what kind of trend I'm looking at.

34:12
 So if you if you just do a quick plot of like data, maybe you can see that some of the data is being clustered into different groups.

34:21
 So you can say, OK, maybe maybe there's something happening in there and then you can pursue on that and then explode it further.

34:28
 So explorative data analysis is just like a quick technique to see what's happening with the data and then that will give you something that you can change and then you will you will do all the analysis to actually validate whether that is true or not.

34:43
 So explorative data analysis is like just just producing quick plots, the quick plots or quick summary table of the data and then based on that you will try to find out OK, what are the opportunity that we have or what are the relationships that we can explore within the data.

34:59
 So visual methods could be producing some plots while the statistical method could be calculating correlation coefficients, They could be we could be looking at the skewness, we could be looking at the mean, median and all those statistical figures to find out OK, what's happening with the data and what's something useful that we can find from this data.

35:21
 And again in order to improve on the scale, we need to work on a lot of data.

35:26
 So keep working on different kinds of data.

35:30
 So work on some data that is that is suited for clustering.

35:34
 There are different clusters of things and then you are trying to find what if if given the new thing, which cluster it might belong to.

35:42
 Or you can work on some data like the linear regression, like price and demand kind of thing.

35:48
 So if the price if the supply with the demand increases, the price increases or things like that.

35:58
 So Next up is now the tool.

36:00
 I think I've already explained it in detail.

36:03
 So you need to learn at least one of these tools, at least one of each of these tools, So an expressive tool like Excel.

36:13
 Another alternative for Excel is Google Seats, but most of the organization don't use Excel so I think it's probably would be like 90% of the organization are using Excel.

36:24
 So I would probably won't recommend anyone to learn Google sits.

36:28
 But having said that, Google sits and Excel are pretty pretty similar.

36:31
 So I mean one scale if you have knowledge on Google sits you can easily transfer that skill over to Excel and the Next up is SQL.

36:41
 So SQL is kind of universal.

36:44
 So if and there are various variations of SQL but at the at the end it's it's kind of similar.

36:53
 So if you know how to read the data from table using SQL that would be probably similar across all the all the SQL variations.

37:01
 And a caveat on that would be that when you are learning these tools, you also need to know how much do you need to learn.

37:09
 Because like if you if you want to go in and learn a query language like Sequel, you can probably keep learning that for six months.

37:18
 Because Sequel is not just used by data and this SQL is also used by database administrator.

37:24
 The Sqls are also used by database developers and all those all those roles, right?

37:28
 So when you are a database developer your your your your intention of using SQL is completely different, right?

37:35
 When you are a database developer you are actually building that database.

37:38
 So you would need to know a lot about a lot about the SQL Server itself, you need to know a lot about access provisions and all those kind of things.

37:47
 But when you are a data analyst, you are not maintaining that database, you are just merely consuming that database right.

37:54
 So you need to just know how you can read the data from the database.

38:00
 You you kind of need to stop there right.

38:02
 Otherwise if you keep learning that then you will you you you are kind of you are kind of learning the things that doesn't directly help you become a data endless.

38:11
 So that's that's that's really important because often time when you Start learning a skill, you kind of don't know when to stop, but you kind of don't know how much of this skill you would need to achieve your goal, right.

38:22
 So your your goal here is to become a data analyst.

38:25
 Your goal here is not to become like a database admin or something.

38:28
 So you don't need to know really heavy SQL, you just need to be able to read data from your database and then the next step is you do the analysis that's that's that's what that's that's all you need to learn in SQL.

38:42
 And Next up is programming language like Python And the same thing applies here as well.

38:47
 You need to know how much of Python to learn.

38:54
 So Python is a general purpose language, right?

38:57
 So Python is used for almost everything you can think of.

39:00
 So Python is used for web development, Python is also used for app development.

39:06
 Python is also used for game development and all those kind of thing.

39:09
 So if you went there to learn Python And then say that OK, I want to learn all of Python, then it will take you years to learn Python, right?

39:18
 But that that, that that would mean that you would be learning all those other things, that doesn't really help you become a data analyst.

39:27
 So like if you if you went in there and learn Python for web development, that's not gonna help you become data analyst, right?

39:34
 So you need to 1st understand what are the things within Python that a data analyst really needs and just learn those skills, right.

39:44
 So you need to set your boundaries first, OK?

39:47
 As a data analyst, these are the things I need to learn in Python so that I can do my task as data analyst but not those all the other things because I didn't care about web development in Python or I didn't care about all those other things in Python.

39:59
 So you need to you need to make sure that you you said those boundaries correct.

40:05
 And the last one again is despoting tool in Power BI.

40:09
 So again in despoting tool as well it's it's up to you how much in depth you wanna go so you can spend again years in the despoting tools.

40:18
 But you you can just start with.

40:21
 OK, so if if this is the dashboarding tool I want to learn, then you would.

40:25
 Then I would need to learn how I can build visualizations within the dashboarding tool.

40:31
 And then the next thing I want to do is I want to make it more interactive.

40:35
 So I want to learn how to add filters, how to drop downs and stuff so that the report is interactive.

40:43
 And then also next Next up off is to do the data modeling in dashboarding tool and that is often overlooked.

40:50
 So a lot of people when they learn to become data unless they kind of skip the data modeling part, so they just do OK, I have the data and I will produce the visualization which is OK in some point.

41:02
 But if you want to become a really good data analyst then you also need to learn the data modeling technique.

41:08
 So data modeling is, it's really important when you are building your reports in really large scale because when when you are building like 10s of 10s of 20s of visualization based on based on like 20 different table, then it starts getting messy really quick.

41:26
 And that's when the data modeling technique will come in.

41:29
 And if you learn the data modeling techniques then it would be it would be really good and you you you would be.

41:39
 Let's see, sorry you you would you would be really good data unless if you can do the data modeling correct.

41:51
 So that's a really valuable skill as well.

41:58
 So Yep, so these are the four things that you need to focus on when you are learning the basic conception tool and that's a step one.

42:06
 So now we will move on to the Step 2 which is putting those skills into action.

42:13
 OK and again this is also some like I won't say misconception, but it's not understood well is that most people just stop after step one.

42:26
 They just think that OK, once you learn the skill you will get the job.

42:29
 But that's not true right?

42:31
 So if you if if people just get job when they learn the skill then everyone would have job right after uni.

42:37
 But it doesn't happen, right?

42:39
 So there are a lot of things that you need to do after learning those skills as well.

42:44
 And that's that's what will eventually get you the role that you want, right?

42:48
 So it's not just the skills.

42:50
 So the next step or Step 2 is now you need, you have learned the skill, you need to put the skills to use using projects.

42:59
 OK, so you need to start working on projects, you use the skill that you acquired to build projects, you build them into portfolio and then you you use those portfolios in your resume to support your skills, right.

43:17
 So just listing your skills on resume doesn't add much value.

43:21
 But if you have projects on your resume that that tells, that tells the employer that yeah you have to use this, this and this skill while working on this project and that will validate your skill, right.

43:34
 So, so in terms of what kind of projects to do, you can think of this thing, so do industry specific real world project, right.

43:45
 So if you are interested in one of the industry, let's say utilities industry or mining industry or finance or banking or whatever, do a industry specific real world project, right.

43:57
 So that's that's what that's what it will distinguish you from others.

44:01
 And then the obvious thing is don't do what everyone else is doing, right?

44:05
 So if you go in Kagal today, there are like 20 or 30 or or like hundreds of projects that everyone else is doing.

44:12
 So what you will do is you will just copy that project and then do it yourself.

44:17
 But that is not distinguishing you from the crowd, right?

44:21
 Because in this other application, it's it's not like uni, it's not like all of you can pass.

44:26
 Job application is a competition, so only one can pass or only one is the best.

44:30
 And you want to be the best, right?

44:32
 So how do you become the best?

44:34
 Is you want to become the best by beating the rest, right?

44:38
 So if you get that, then what you need to do is you need to do something that no one else is doing right?

44:46
 And then so and how do you do that is that you pick your project based on your interest, right?

44:54
 And your interest is unique to you, right.

44:56
 And when you pick project based on your interest, then there is some definitely something that you can give more than others, right?

45:04
 So if your interest is in let's say sports, do a project in sports, right, because you know a lot of things because it's your interest, you you probably know a lot more about that sport.

45:15
 So you can put that into your project and that will make it a really great project and that's why we distinguish you from all the other people who just did the tagger project, right.

45:26
 And then the last thing that I say quite a lot is that make sure that your project is solving a problem.

45:32
 If your problem, if your project is not solving a problem, if your project is just like OK building a visualization for this data, then it's it's it's not of real use like it's hard to communicate that to your perspective employer as well.

45:47
 Like when someone says what did you do in this project.

45:50
 Yeah I just visualize some bunch of bunch of data that doesn't add much value.

45:54
 But if you say OK, so I did that project because the business was having problem acts and with this with this analytics or with this with the insights from the data, we realized that we can do something better or we can we can improve the efficiency of certain thing and it save the business this much amount of money or something like that.

46:13
 So if you can't face your projects as a problem and solution to the problem, then that will make a real impact rather than just some random data utilization project from Cagle.

46:29
 And the next thing is once you do the project, you need to make sure that the project is visible to other people, right?

46:37
 So if you do your project and your project sits in your computer, how would how would the world know about it right?

46:43
 So people would only know when you tell them right?

46:46
 So make sure your projects are visible, Build a portfolio of projects and then so it so it to your potential employers.

46:54
 And also make sure that you build your projects to cover a variety of skills like the skills that are the tools that we mentioned like Excel, SQL, Python, Power BI.

47:03
 Make sure you have at least a project that touches each of them right?

47:08
 Because when you put them into your resume now later, what will happen is that you will have at least one project to support one of the scale and that way it will make us make make it into a solid resume.

47:21
 And next thing is to get feedback on your projects in portfolio.

47:25
 So when you are doing projects on your own, it's often hard to know whether whether you're doing it really well or whether you're supposed to do something else.

47:34
 So ask for feedback.

47:36
 Maybe ask some industry industry experts or even your friends or colleagues.

47:42
 Ask them to review how what they feel about your projects and portfolio.

47:46
 If they have any feedbacks, maybe you incorporate that into your project and make it even better.

47:51
 So those are the things you can do to put your skills into use and that way you are building credibility on your skills and when you go into job application that will that will really bolster your resume.

48:14
 So Next up is show your skill and we kind of already touched on this one is that once you have learned the scale done the project what's next is now you need to tell the world that you are ready so you you need to not you put put your put the word out there that OK you have got the skills and you know how to use those skills and now you you are about you are ready to take some real accent right So you have turn your leg so now it's time to show the world right.

48:44
 So remember, you need to put yourself out there.

48:47
 Because like I said, if if your technical skill is here but your communication skill is here, then people pee you as here, right?

48:56
 Because they only see what you show them.

48:58
 They don't see where you are.

49:00
 But so you need to be able to show yourself up.

49:03
 You need to open yourself.

49:05
 You need to reach out as many people as you want, as you can.

49:09
 And that way, that way and only that way you can get into the radar of your prospective employees.

49:17
 And that's how you will end the job, right?

49:23
 So yeah, like I said, if you have, if you have got lots of skills, but if you can't put that in, if you can't put that into resume or if you can't have sufficient evidence of those skills in your resume, then it's of no use.

49:38
 The prospective employee doesn't perceive you is having those skills, right?

49:43
 So and how do you do that is again like we said use projects as evidence or if you have any other experience use that as as the credibility to add it to your resume.

50:00
 So in your resume you you need to always answer this question, right?

50:06
 So the question is why are you the best candidate for this job?

50:10
 And always, always remember this, right?

50:12
 So it's not about being a suitable candidate, you have to be the best candidate because one of the best one gets the job right.

50:20
 So you need to be best out of all the candidates.

50:24
 So the the way I do it or the the way you can do it as well is that review your resume and think if you were the employer, will you give the person with this resume the job and you, you, you, you can be honest with yourself, right.

50:37
 And revise your resume until the answer is yes.

50:41
 OK.

50:41
 So always ask this question.

50:44
 You have a resume on your hand and see, OK.

50:47
 So if that if that was if I was the employer and that was the person applying for the job, would I give him the job compared to all the other kind of compared to all the other kinds of resume that I could have.

50:58
 And yeah, you need to get a answer of S in that.

51:01
 In that.

51:02
 Yeah, to that question.

51:04
 Only then you can be confident that, OK, yeah, I might be able to or I might have a shot at this job.

51:14
 Right.

51:18
 So Next up is, OK, So now I have said that you need to be the best candidate for the job, but how you can be the best, best candidate for that job, right.

51:27
 And like I said, to be the best, you need to beat the rest.

51:31
 So do something that no one else is doing.

51:34
 So what?

51:35
 What is everyone else doing?

51:36
 Everyone else is putting the resume.

51:38
 They're applying for the job, but maybe they're not doing these things that you can do so that you can get that ace over all the other other participants or all the applicants, right?

51:49
 So that could be industry specific projects, right?

51:52
 Let's say you're applying for data and this role in a bank or or or a bank you have got a project in banking domain then that would they will probably prioritize you over someone else who has done like some random projects or haven't done any projects at all, right.

52:07
 So those kind of things can give you age over other other other applicants, right.

52:13
 So if you're applying for the job in certain industry, then it takes some time like one or two weeks to build some relevant project and put that into resume that that can really increase your chances of getting hired or getting getting through the next stage of the application, right.

52:30
 So that's one thing and the other thing as you probably like all of you know is networking and connecting to the people in the industry, right.

52:39
 So when you like chat, chat to the people who are already working in that industry, then you would know like OK, what are the pinpoints in that industry or what are the recent trends in that industry.

52:51
 And then based on that you can put something in your resume or again you can put something towards your project that can help you or that that gives you that that gives your perspective important idea that OK, this person is kind of has got some knowledge around the industry and that's, that's, that's the edge you need.

53:10
 All right.

53:11
 And then the Next up is yeah, giving a call to your recruiter or hiring manager before the interview to ask for more context.

53:18
 And it could be like I would probably like it unless you have got their personal number, maybe don't don't give them a call, maybe an e-mail would be relevant as well.

53:27
 But if you have got your interview lined up and if you kind of send up, send, send, send them a message or e-mail saying that, can you give me a bit more context about the interview, like the panel audience and all those kind of things, Then that probably would make you stand out because maybe not all the applicants are doing it right.

53:48
 So and that would also give you a bit more context that you can work on and do your research so that you can do better in the interview.

53:57
 And and the last step is looking up about the company hiring manager to find something that you can use to advantage.

54:02
 So look look up for the company what they do what what their main business is what are their what are their motto what what are they what are their values.

54:11
 And if you can, if you if you can combine them and if you if you research them, well then you can go into the interview.

54:18
 And then if you answer the questions as like using the company values, a company's objective, then that will resonate with them more better.

54:28
 And then that increases your chances of getting the job.

54:32
 Because interview is not just about the technical skills or examining the technical knowledge, it's also about examining the cultural fit, right.

54:42
 So if you can see, if you can tell them that you kind of already know the organization's value, then that that will give you the edge and you need to beat the other applicants.

54:57
 And yeah, I already said about the communication skills.

55:01
 So they all sees what you saw them, right?

55:04
 So they they won't see the real you.

55:06
 And if you can't communicate it better, if you can't put it out then then then they would they would never know right?

55:15
 So how you can be better at your communication skills?

55:19
 First thing is you can practice mock interviews.

55:22
 Again practice mock interviews with someone because the only way to improve your communication skill is from feedback because if you are not getting feedback you you kind of don't really know if you're doing better.

55:34
 Having said that, you can you can probably improve on yourself as well.

55:39
 Like if you if you are practicing for like a video interview or even face to face interview try to record yourself doing, doing or replying to a question and then hear it yourself then yeah you can you can provide yourself feedback in that in that sense as well.

55:56
 But more than that, it it is always good to get feedback from someone else and that could be your friends or family or that could be someone or some you.

56:07
 You can ask help from someone in the industry if you if you have got the connection.

56:13
 And just like any other skills, communication skill can be learned and you all you need to do is yeah find the right resources and practice.

56:22
 So practice probably is the one of the most like most important way or most most relevant way to improve your communication skill.

56:37
 OK, so after the communication scale, so Next up if you have got now we have got all the communication.

56:54
 This case you have got, if you have got really straighter stellar resume, you have got projects as well and all those things.

57:01
 But there is still one thing that could that could be a struggle or that could prevent you from getting the job that you want and it's the local experience, right.

57:14
 So when you are trying to get your first job, it's it's it's kind of this never ending loop, isn't it?

57:20
 So you need a job to get an interview or experience and you need an experience to get a job and it's just like seems like there is no way out.

57:29
 But if you think strategically there there is a way out of that thing and it is intensives, freelancing, volunteering.

57:38
 And if you can't, if you can't do any of these, then try working on real world projects and do anything that that gets you into action because that's that's what local experience is Like.

57:49
 If you if you are working on local problems then you kind of know what the issues are in there and then if you if you know how to fix these issues that's that's what they mean when they are looking for local, local experience.

58:04
 It's not like it's not like this.

58:05
 They are trying to find that you're OK you need to be and need to have work experience in certain country.

58:13
 They are kind of more looking into.

58:14
 You need to know the work culture of this country because the the work culture kind of makes a lot of difference in how the work is being done.

58:25
 Fine.

58:25
 So that's what they're looking for.

58:27
 So if you can't get any intensives, freelancing, volunteering, that would be the way for you to get that local experience really needed for you to land that job, Okay.

58:45
 So that's a wrap on the roadmap.

58:50
 So if you have any questions till this point, please feel free to raise it.

58:56
 Otherwise we will get into the demonstration.

59:09
 Okay, okay.

59:17
 So again, yeah, yeah.

59:26
 And I want to ask about the interns save.

59:30
 How how this program will help to get the intensive like like for me I'm not any student here so how how can this program will help me to to get into the intensive so that so that I can get local experience.

59:48
 Here is I'm not a student here.

59:50
 So yeah, I I want to know how this program will help me to lead into the data like intensive program.

59:58
 OK Yeah.

59:59
 Thanks so much motion for asking that.

1:00:00
 So in our program, so the Data Profession Academy is currently starting a session from September 30.

1:00:08
 So that course is a 14 weeks hands on course with live sessions every week.

1:00:18
 And at the end of the 14 weeks you will learn all the all the all the tools and skills that you need to become a data endless like all the four steps that we we just talked about.

1:00:30
 And at the end of the course you are you are guaranteed to have an intensive within Australian based company.

1:00:37
 So our our company the Data Profession Academy has got has got ties with local Australian companies.

1:00:45
 Some of them are software based companies, some of some of them our service based companies.

1:00:50
 But those companies will be providing you with the internship.

1:00:54
 So it can be up to 14 to 16 weeks internship depending on the depending on the company.

1:01:01
 So you will work with the company on real world projects, so they will give you project to work on.

1:01:06
 You will also get an internship supervisor who will supervise you throughout the internship and you will work work on real world, a real world project with the with the companies and at the end that's that that that's that's how you will gain the local experience and the intensive you really need to get your first like online.

1:01:27
 Yeah so intensive so yeah online yeah.

1:01:30
 So yeah and like we are busy in the work and how can we like we need, we need to like communicate with them in the fixed days or how can we communicate with them when we wants to like if there is like NQV or something like that we need to we may feel like I need to ask some question with them about the project.

1:01:53
 I need help.

1:01:53
 So how can we communicate with them or like it is like fixed days or something like that.

1:01:59
 So and that's that's up to you as well.

1:02:02
 So when you start an intensive you, you will get contacts with your the company or the client and then you will also get contact to your internship supervisor.

1:02:13
 So it all depends on the availability of you 3 right.

1:02:17
 So if you you can decide your availability with clients say I got I got work or I I, I have this time available can we meet at that around that time to finalize our requirement then that's that's completely up to you 3 to to manage your availability and it's it's quite flexible as well.

1:02:35
 So it's not like just the intensive it's that's supposed to be one day a week.

1:02:39
 But you can if your time if your time doesn't permit then you can break it down into two days like half half day 2 day and a week or anything that you you can get an agreement with the client and then the internsive supervisor again there will be 1 consultation per week or if you need more than that then you can always like contact the internsive supervisor and say OK I need really I really need help on this on this part then you can they they are they are always available for for any queries that you might have that will be great.

1:03:13
 So we can discuss it later when you join the class.

1:03:15
 Yeah, yeah, yeah and and thank you so much.

1:03:19
 Yeah, no worries And and even the intensive start date, if you have got some prior commitment and stuff then we can play around the intensive start date as well.

1:03:26
 So it's, it's completely up to you and your schedule.

1:03:31
 Thank you, Sudaru.

1:03:33
 Cheers.

1:03:33
 Thanks.

1:03:37
 OK.

1:03:37
 So so the the objective of this demo is not not just to so so this project but to help you guys to come up with some project ideas.

1:03:49
 Because what I what I've heard a lot when I when I talk with students is that they kind of they can learn the skills online or with any other online resources available but they kind of struggle with the projects like they they kind of struggle to come up with project ideas or what kind of projects can I work on.

1:04:07
 So I wanted to give this example to like to get you started with.

1:04:13
 OK, maybe start thinking this way so that you can come up with good project ideas.

1:04:17
 So how to get project ideas?

1:04:20
 So first thing I would say is just look around you, right?

1:04:23
 So your goal is to make your project as relatable to your employer as possible.

1:04:28
 So what?

1:04:29
 What are your target employer right?

1:04:31
 So what what company do you want to work for?

1:04:33
 And and what what will you do next is you will stop them.

1:04:38
 I mean that their company, so you can stop them, they're not individuals.

1:04:41
 Well, so you can, you can follow them and see what they are doing right and then try to come up with some projects that kind of relates to their vision, right.

1:04:51
 So if they want to do, if they want to become carbon neutral by 2050, maybe there are, there are some projects in that space that you can do right, maybe you can try to build like their carbon footprint tracker report or something like that, right.

1:05:06
 So that's that's just some ideas, right.

1:05:08
 So think of your potential employers, see what they're interested in and try to do a project that is even even remotely related to that, then that will, that will, that will be interesting to them, right.

1:05:22
 Because if if a project is interesting to them, then that will start the conversation.

1:05:27
 And that's that's why I have felt in a lot of the interviews that I have been with been to as well.

1:05:31
 Like most of the time, especially when I when I was straight out of uni, the first talking point in my interview was usually the project.

1:05:40
 So we just start talking about the project and then we get into OK, what are the things that we that what are the tools that are used in the project and then we start the conversation from there.

1:05:50
 So a project must be a conversation starter, right?

1:05:53
 As I might say, because if if that's the case then they probably won't even need to ask you about OK do do you know Python or whatever?

1:06:02
 Because if you have two projects using Python then there is no point asking you about like technical skills and pythons or anything like that.

1:06:10
 So how to make the how to make the project more interesting then right.

1:06:15
 So first thing you need to do is you project must solve a problem because it's easy to identify a problem and then say because if you if you if your project name indicates that there is a problem and this is solution to that problem then people will get interested in how did you solve that problem right.

1:06:36
 So and the next thing is the project needs to be interesting to you.

1:06:39
 So if you have some interest in that topic then then only you will produce really great outcomes right?

1:06:47
 If you're just doing the project for the sake of doing it, then it it probably won't be that interesting because it wasn't interesting to you at all.

1:06:53
 Then how can you make it interesting to other people, right.

1:06:57
 And the third thing is it needs to be unique to you.

1:07:00
 So if everyone else is doing the same project, then yeah, it's not it's not differentiating.

1:07:04
 So that's that's that's of no usage as well.

1:07:08
 And then it it also needs to be easy to explain to potential employer.

1:07:12
 So if if your project is really hard to explain, then yeah, no, no one else would get it.

1:07:17
 And you probably won't get it.

1:07:19
 It won't get your employer excited as well.

1:07:23
 So let's have a look at one example.

1:07:27
 OK, so this is my current, but yeah, I'm I'm, I'm not using like any any secret information or something.

1:07:37
 This is public information.

1:07:38
 This is just a press release.

1:07:40
 So what a corporation is introducing the largest smart meter pilot.

1:07:46
 So what smart meter really is, is that in your home you have got those water meters, right?

1:07:50
 So it's a spins and it gives you the water meter reading but they are trying to replace that with smart water meter.

1:07:56
 So the smart water meter comes with battery and it has got remote access.

1:08:01
 So the smart meter now can send your water users data hourly to water corporation.

1:08:09
 And what they're planning to do is that once they have this hourly data, they want to identify leaks or they want to identify abnormal users in your houses so that they can they can identify those leaks.

1:08:21
 And I didn't and notify the customer early so that they can save the water because water is precious research, right.

1:08:28
 So it's when when there is a water leakage, there are two things happening.

1:08:31
 One, what is getting wasted.

1:08:33
 Two, your bill is going up, right.

1:08:35
 So if we can notify the customer in advance that would be a really good that that would that would solve this problem or that would that would be a really good solution, right.

1:08:45
 So that's that's what we'll do next do, do today we will try to see how we can help World Cup identify those leaks and does that sound like an interesting project.

1:08:57
 This is, this is the kind of thing you can find online as well like go to your potential employers, try to see what's happening on their run and you can also source for like if you want to source it mining.

1:09:11
 So it's like mining and then combine with data analytics and then maybe also combine with Perth if you just want to keep it to Perth.

1:09:18
 Then you can see what are the recent news that combine all those keywords and then you can see, OK, so this company is actually doing this thing in the data analytics space.

1:09:28
 So that could form your idea for the project and that's that's that, that's that that would make it really interesting as well because if you are then applying to that company then they can easily relate to, OK.

1:09:40
 So this is the kind of project that we, our company was trying to do as well.

1:09:45
 So yeah, let's, let's get started on this one.

1:09:50
 First, let's have a look at the data and this is obviously mocked data.

1:09:53
 I don't have access to data, just the word it uses data.

1:09:58
 So if we look at this data you can see that there is the meter number and there is the date and time and there is the water uses right?

1:10:08
 So this is this is the kind of data that we we will get right?

1:10:11
 And this is just mock data, I just put some random numbers in there but based on this so every hour we know how much water is being used.

1:10:20
 So based on this information, how can we identify if there is any leak at all, right.

1:10:27
 So that's, that's our challenge.

1:10:29
 So how would we get started is that we will first identify the patterns, right.

1:10:35
 We will first look into how how people actually use water, right?

1:10:40
 Do they use water really a lot in the morning and then maybe during the day they don't use that much and then in the evening they use again more or something like that.

1:10:49
 So we want to 1st identify that pattern and then if anything out of ordinary appears in that pattern, maybe that's because of the leak.

1:10:57
 There could be other reasons as well which we can't say for sure, but let's first look at the pattern and see if we can use that pattern to identify any leaks or abnormal uses.

1:11:12
 So if we so using the data I saw you on the next slide if we plot the Everest water uses by hour this is how we get this is this is the output we get right.

1:11:24
 So as you can see people don't really use water that much until 4:00 AM but maybe after 5:00 AM people wake up and then they take shower and that's how the there's a huge spike in water users because everyone is taking shower and then maybe after like 56789 maybe that's the time people leave for offices.

1:11:44
 So this one doesn't include the water users in office because office are commercial properties.

1:11:49
 So this, this is just for residential properties.

1:11:52
 So in the residential property what uses decreases after 9 because much of the people have left for office, right And then after that it would probably go go around another, go around another cycle, but that's that's how it looks like right.

1:12:09
 And this, this gives us really good, really good information that we can use to, to detect licks or anything, right?

1:12:20
 So if you look in here and this is really low, so if we look at some of the house, then the water uses during the, what they call a quiet hour is between like 2L to 5:00 AM or two L to 4:00 AM.

1:12:35
 No one really should be using water because they're they're they're asleep, right.

1:12:41
 And if there is some water uses in that like dead hour as they call it, then that is in potential indication of a leak.

1:12:51
 And there could be other other other like whole complicated logic as well.

1:12:55
 But we're just trying to make it as simplistic as possible, right.

1:12:59
 So if there is a constant water uses even during the dead hours that's what we would need to flag as a leak and then there will be like some some other things that we would do next to conform that it is a leak.

1:13:13
 But that's that's that's how we can like put it at really simplistic label that's that's how we will we will flag something as leak.

1:13:22
 So if we really want to see it in action let's have a look at the data.

1:13:28
 So I will pull this thing in here.

1:13:32
 Let's be okay can see if we can.

1:13:50
 Can you see the excel?

1:13:52
 Now can everyone see the excel or am I sharing something wrong?

1:13:58
 Yes, yes you can see the excel.

1:14:03
 Yeah okay.

1:14:05
 So let's load up the data first.

1:14:07
 So I'm I will be using Excel for everything today because it's really easy, simple and intuitive and it's easy to show as well.

1:14:16
 So I will go to the data tab and then get data.

1:14:21
 So I want to use the I want to get the data.

1:14:24
 I have stored the data at CSV in my computer, so I will just load the data from that CSV and that's that's probably the most frequent pattern that you will see in industry as well.

1:14:36
 And most of the data will be just in CSV because it's human relabel.

1:14:39
 It's easy to store and it will just load up that CSV into your analytics tool, whatever that might be, like Excel, Python, Power BI, whatever.

1:14:50
 So I will load the CSV so I would need to get it first.

1:14:56
 So that is the data, what it uses.

1:15:05
 OK, so as you can see it has got the meter number, it has got timestamp and it has got the water users, right.

1:15:14
 So if you remember the slide that I showed you, it had the date and time separated into different columns and maybe that's what we want to do next as well.

1:15:28
 So we would want to split the date and time separately so that we can do aggregates based on different things, right.

1:15:35
 So we can do aggregates based on date as well, so that we can find out what was the minimum uses for that date.

1:15:42
 But we also probably want to do what is the minimum uses or what are the average uses per hour.

1:15:49
 So the time information is also important.

1:15:52
 So what I will do next is I will click on Transform Data because I need to transform this data because I need to do some some of the changes so I will click transform.

1:16:03
 So this is the power query and if you have used Excel before you probably haven't used this Power query editor.

1:16:08
 But as an analyst this is probably one of the most useful feature in Excel.

1:16:14
 So Power Query Editor lets you apply the transformation that you need on the data.

1:16:20
 So the transformation that I need on this one is to split the date and time right?

1:16:25
 So I'll click on this column and then here you can see something called split column.

1:16:31
 There you go, pretty easy.

1:16:33
 So and I want to split by delimiter or position.

1:16:38
 So delimiter is the character that you want to separate at right?

1:16:42
 So you can see there is a comma between the date and time so I want to separate it, So what it will do next is that it will create 2 columns based on the values from, but it didn't seem to pick it so it was supposed to separate it, but it did not.

1:17:04
 So let's see what went wrong.

1:17:06
 So it's probably not at, then.

1:17:08
 Sorry about that.

1:17:13
 It's probably at space.

1:17:18
 Yeah, there you go.

1:17:19
 So there was no, actually, there was space.

1:17:21
 There was.

1:17:22
 The comma was just there when when we're viewing it.

1:17:26
 So now you can see it has separated it into date and time.

1:17:32
 The time has also been separated to time and AM PM which is probably OK for now.

1:17:39
 Now we can rename this.

1:17:40
 So I want to rename it and call it.

1:17:42
 I think I need to redo it.

1:17:56
 So let's change this one to the telemeter of space.

1:18:05
 Okay.

1:18:06
 There you go.

1:18:06
 And now I want to rename this.

1:18:09
 So this is my date, this is my time and this is my time of day.

1:18:31
 Something okay.

1:18:33
 So once I have done this one I can just do close and load.

1:18:51
 It's getting the data and if it's taking too long, I have got a copy of it, said so if it takes a bit longer, I will probably start from the other one, take only.

1:19:28
 OK, let's see.

1:19:29
 Let's use this one now.

1:19:32
 So that that one took a while to load, but can you see the data being loaded here in the Excel Express here?

1:19:46
 Yeah.

1:19:54
 Can everyone see the data now?

1:19:58
 Yes.

1:19:59
 OK, Yeah.

1:20:00
 Thanks.

1:20:01
 So now we have got this data in this format.

1:20:03
 So let's, let's start doing some exploration, right.

1:20:07
 So the first thing I want to do.

1:20:10
 Is I want to create a pivot table.

1:20:13
 And pivot tables are kind of like summary tables, right?

1:20:16
 So we have got this data, we want to summarize it in different ways that we want.

1:20:21
 So I will create a new pivot table.

1:20:23
 I'll just press OK, I've selected the table, so that's the table.

1:20:26
 How?

1:20:27
 That's the data I will use to create this pivot table.

1:20:30
 And in the pivot table I will put time on one end and then the water uses its value and OK so if I do that so it's keeping me sum of total water uses Total water uses in that in during the hours.

1:20:55
 So I can quickly just produce a plot of this to see the pattern.

1:21:07
 So if I insert the bar so that's giving me.

1:21:16
 I didn't want it to count so probably need to remove this.

1:21:30
 So what I need to do now is this one.

1:21:34
 I instead of count, I want this to be an average.

1:21:44
 So every of what he uses and the no that is doing every of some.

1:21:53
 Sorry about that again.

1:21:54
 So every of and this paper table is wrong.

1:21:59
 Now let's take out these two.

1:22:07
 So time goes into rows and then water uses goes into the column.

1:22:14
 So this is yeah this is what I wanted so I can select this and I can produce the bar chart.

1:22:24
 So the yeah this was the chart I used in this slide.

1:22:27
 So you can see how the users changes over time.

1:22:31
 So that that that gave us an indication of, yeah, maybe there is something like the dead hour that we can use to find out whether there is a leak or not.

1:22:41
 So the next I will do, next thing I will do is I will need to find out what was the minimum uses, do minimum uses during the hour, right.

1:22:53
 Because what we were interested in is that if there is no minimum uses for the for the dead hour, right.

1:23:02
 So our items are now is that there need to be at least an hour in a day where there is no water uses because people are supposed to sleep, right.

1:23:14
 So if there is no hour in the day where there has been a 0 water uses, that's a leak because people can't stay away for 24 hours.

1:23:25
 So that's probably something leaking because it's leaking 24 hours, right?

1:23:32
 But that could not be true as well, right.

1:23:35
 So if you are having a party, if you are having like if you have like too many people living in the house, they are coming in going in different hours, then there's a situation where the water is running for 24 hours as well, right.

1:23:47
 So there are users in 24 hours.

1:23:49
 But we'll just go with the simplistic assumption and say that if there is no hour in the day where the water uses what zero, that would mean that there has been there, there was a leak, right.

1:24:03
 So what I want to do next is that I need to find the minimum uses of water during the day, right.

1:24:10
 So what was the hour or what was the uses in the hour?

1:24:14
 What where where the water uses was minimum, right.

1:24:18
 So it could be like in the night time when everyone is sleeping, that's when it's supposed to be minimum.

1:24:23
 And that minimum is supposed to be 0 because no one is supposed to be using the water right?

1:24:28
 So the next thing I will do is I will again do a pivot table but instead of time now I will do the date because I want to find the minimum uses for that date.

1:24:40
 Does that make sense?

1:24:44
 So if I do a pivot table again and you can do as many pivot tables as you want.

1:24:49
 So I will put date in the rows or in the columns and then I will put the meter number in the rows and then I'll put the water uses in the value.

1:25:02
 So it's currently doing the sum.

1:25:04
 So I need to change it to average or mean because that's what I'm interested in.

1:25:11
 So when I do the mean you can see a lot of means are just zero because people just for at least one hour in a day, they don't use water.

1:25:19
 That's true for most of them, but some of them as you can see there is some uses for all of that those days.

1:25:26
 So there is no hour in a day where they haven't used the water and that's an indication of leak.

1:25:35
 And here you go as well there is constant use of 8-9, so I will maybe mark up those two.

1:25:44
 So that's one and that's one.

1:25:50
 So those are the potential indicators of leaks and we can put multiple layers of logic on top and say that if there was a potential leak yesterday and if if the same water uses is continuing on today and tomorrow that that that probably gives us even more confidence that this is absolutely and leak because if there was no water turned off yesterday, it's probably not turned off today as well.

1:26:17
 So it's continuously leaking, right.

1:26:20
 So as you can see, so this one maybe some others you can see that it was it has been one for some other day but it has been zero after before and after.

1:26:29
 So that means that that's probably was that probably was one day that they were they were having something.

1:26:35
 So yeah this these are the kind of analysis and and it's pretty simple, right.

1:26:39
 So when you think of it leak detection it kind of seems like ohh that's that's like a really big thing or something.

1:26:44
 But when you look at data level it's, it's kind of really simple, right.

1:26:49
 So you just are finding the minimum of the day and then you're just checking whether that is 0 or not and this could like if this could become really good project as well, right, because at the end in implementation level it's really simple but at the problem and solution level this is really huge, right, because we are we are identifying, we are identifying leaks and that has got really good business value because you you are identifying leaks and you can now notify your customer in advance that's that's that's really huge, right.

1:27:27
 So these are the kind of projects you can think of and I mean it's it's not it's not as easy to find a problems like this but if you keep yourself up to date on what what what are the what are the industry is doing, what are the what are the relevant industry focusing on in their data and analytics journey then you can find these kind of projects.

1:27:52
 So that's pretty much it on the demo side.

1:27:57
 So we'll start setting the presentation again.

1:28:04
 Just give me a minute, just one more minute.

1:28:38
 So yeah these are the kind of projects you can you can think of as well.

1:28:42
 And if you if you have got any idea on your mind and see how I can make it into a project or how I can make it more industry relevant, then yeah, just send me a message and I'll be happy to work with you to to refine your project ideas and how you can make it like more presentable or more appealing to your prospective employees.

1:29:11
 So that's a wrap on the event and I wanted to take this moment and talk about the Data Profession Academy as well if any of you are interested.

1:29:24
 So Data Profession Academy is an online course provider as you can see.

1:29:30
 So we are offering Data Profession 101 course which is starting from 30th September.

1:29:38
 So the enrollment is currently open.

1:29:40
 So it is a 14 weeks course which which which runs for 14 weeks and runs on weekends.

1:29:48
 So it runs on Saturday and Sunday and the session starts from 8:00 AM to and it runs till 3 for three hours and it give it.

1:29:58
 It teaches you all the skills that you need to become data endless.

1:30:02
 So all the four steps that I just mentioned, so learning the skills like Excel, SQL, Python, Power BI and all these soft skills as well like critical thinking, project management, problem solving, those are the kind of skills that it's really hard to learn and not a lot of other online courses provided teach you that skill and that's that's the kind of thing that differentiates you from other applicants when you are when you're in your job search journey, right.

1:30:29
 So that's that's the thing we will also focus on.

1:30:33
 And then the Next up is the statistics and data analytics.

1:30:36
 Those are the basic concepts I said about it in this step one.

1:30:40
 So we will teach you all the basic concepts and tools required for data analytics.

1:30:46
 And then Next up we will also guide you to find best project ideas and build those projects into portfolio so that you can make your resume shine.

1:30:58
 And then the last and probably the most important one is the career support.

1:31:02
 So once you graduate, until you land your first job, we will provide you with all the career support that you will need.

1:31:11
 So that includes your resume building.

1:31:14
 That includes your cover letter writing.

1:31:17
 That includes your LinkedIn network and connection.

1:31:20
 That includes interview, preparation, everything that could help you land your first data job.

1:31:26
 We will do it.

1:31:28
 And then not even that.

1:31:29
 We also guarantee the intensive open completion of this course and like Mussamla said, so that intensive is guaranteed.

1:31:39
 So once you complete the course, if you want to get an intensive, you will get an intensive.

1:31:44
 If you don't want any, if you get a job straight away, then yeah, that's really good.

1:31:49
 We will always hope that you you, you, you get the job as soon as you can.

1:31:55
 But if you want the intensive then the intensive will be available.

1:31:58
 It will do an intensive with an Australian best company.

1:32:01
 So you will work with the client from the company but you will also get an intensive supervisor that will be from us and then the intensive supervisor will guide you through the project and what what what you can do, how you can negotiate with the clients or how you essentially just with the internship so that you can the experience working on real life project.

1:32:26
 So if you're interested in you know about the course, I want to know anything more about that just send send me a message or my my number is right there so you can you can give me a call as well.

1:32:41
 So yeah that's about data profession Academy.

1:32:46
 Yeah.

1:32:46
 Most of you got question.

1:32:49
 Yes, this looks like very interesting program is like I'm I'm, I want to change, I want to change my career as well here.

1:32:58
 And it's look like very interesting to me because I'm from IT background in my country and doing the like other jobs here and I really wants to know I I'm, I'm and I get like fed up from the other looks like here.

1:33:14
 So.

1:33:14
 So I'm looking really you know forward to getting to it.

1:33:18
 So I have a few question about it.

1:33:20

1:35:36
 So if you go to Data Profession Academy, then navigate to this course, the Data Profession 11, this is the course I was talking about.

1:35:45
 So in this course we'll have 5 plus portfolio projects, we'll have 25 plus Hanson tutorial.

1:35:52
 So all the live sessions I have, I have make it like a tutorial session.

1:35:57
 So it's more interactive.

1:35:59
 You kind of learn by doing and then there are more than 100 plus hours of content and there will be 20 at live station.

1:36:06
 So that's two live station per week for 14 weeks.

1:36:10
 So we've got 13 more days for our next session to start.

1:36:16
 And like I said, it's it's 2499, but with the only discount that I just mentioned, it will come down to 1999.

1:36:23
 And we have got multiple upcoming events.

1:36:26
 So this is the event that we are having now the data analyst word map.

1:36:29
 So Next up is a day in life is data analyst and then after that it will be the first week of the course.

1:36:36
 So you can see if you go to this website now and do a free sign up, then you can view the course outline and as a whole.

1:36:47
 So in the course outline you can see what are the things that you will learn throughout this course.

1:36:52
 So there is introduction to data data acquisition, storage, Excel, Python, SQL, Power BI, like I said.

1:36:59
 And then there are the sub scales.

1:37:01
 We have got the data wrangling scales.

1:37:04
 We've got the statistics, we've got the data analytics, deep type data storytelling, which is more tailored for the communication skills and data visualization skills.

1:37:14
 And then we go to the portfolio project and the career support section.

1:37:19
 So even today if you go & up like sign up for free, you can actually access some of these contents.

1:37:26
 So if I go in here and I can actually go to these contents and if you if you see in each of the content there are multiple reading resources available.

1:37:38
 So you can have reading resources like an ebook.

1:37:40
 So if you don't prefer watching videos then you can just read on your at your own pace and then you can understand the concepts or there are recorded videos for each section so you can watch the video and then yeah learn the skills as well.

1:37:56
 So there are both reading based resources, there are videos and then there are tutorials.

1:38:03
 So those tutorials are the ones that will be discussed in the session.

1:38:08
 So after the tutorial you can see the online session.

1:38:11
 So that would be the online session that we that that we do every Saturday and Sunday.

1:38:16
 And then in that online session we will do all the activities that we have mentioned in the tutorial and all the other things.

1:38:24
 If you have any questions regarding the course content or anything that has to do with this module, we will discuss it there.

1:38:33
 And if you have any questions, that's what we will discuss in the online session.

1:38:40
 And after that, that's probably the most precious section in each module is there is always more because it's this course is not just about learning technical skills or learning learning data analytics skills or anything.

1:38:55
 This this course is about getting the job and getting the job needs more than just the skills, right?

1:39:01
 So there are small things like how to stay up to date in the latest industry trends, how to, how to project confidence when you are taking an interview or how to how to leverage your unique strengths when when building your projects and those kind of really small details that that helps you get get your first job right.

1:39:25
 So this there is always more section is also really, really important.

1:39:28
 This is, this is something that would have been like putting so much of our equal in.

1:39:36
 It's all to give you a edge in your job application because that's our goal.

1:39:40
 Our goal is to get you the data analytics job.

1:39:45

15:25
 So we will first talk about why data analytics career or why business analytics career and why, why would you would you even consider that career path.

15:34
 OK.

15:35
 So we, we will first talk about why and then later on we'll talk about so now you know why the data analytics career could be good for your future.

15:50
 So good morning, everyone.

15:53
 Thanks so much for taking me some time from your day-to-day and joining our session.

15:59
 I am Susan Tangana.

16:00
 I'm the founder and instructor of Data Profession Academy.

16:04
 And yeah, I want to welcome you everyone, to today's session.

16:09
 So, yeah, we don't have that much agenda today.

16:13
 So first we'll try to do some ice breaker is just to get everyone up and going, just give everyone a chance to share their experience.

16:23
 And then after that I will talk about how I got into data and then we also look into what are the different career paths that we have within data.

16:32
 And then lastly, we will talk about how you can become the analyst, OK, And how we help you with that as well.

16:41
 OK.

16:42
 So first like and that's that's again like communication 101 is that when you are presenting something you need to know your audience and then you just give them a chance to get involved in some sort of ice breaker and that's what I would would like us to do here as well.

16:58
 So if you can like, and I will, I'll probably like like call you out.

17:02
 And if you're not comfortable doing that, then that's fine as well.

17:05
 You can, you can say I would like to skip, but if you can, can you like turn off your video if possible and then introduce yourself.

17:12
 If you don't want to turn it off, turn it on, then just just introduce yourself as well.

17:17
 And then yeah, tell us a bit more about yourself like what what your maybe what your background is and why you know, why you're interested in data and your dates.

17:26
 And then just just again as a Asperger activity, I would also like to know what was the last movie you watched.

17:32
 OK And maybe I will drop somebody in first.

17:36
 So can someone wants to volunteer or also call out some names maybe like Vikram, I think we were chatting before.

17:45
 So if you would like to go next, just give a bit bit of introduction about yourself and then and then tell us what was the last movie it was just to get things up and running.

17:59

 Major is business analytics.

19:43
 So I'm trying to get in the IT industry, but because I don't have experience, it's, it's really hard for me right now.

19:50

21:19
 So sorry about that, Prasanth.

21:22
 If you want to introduce yourself as well, OK, looks like the audio issue or skip, that's that's fine as well.

22:02
 Good afternoon, everyone.

22:02
 My name is Shrikhan and I'm based in Melbourne so I've done my master's in IT as well and my major is computer networking and since I don't have any experience in IT so I just wanna get into the IT since I haven't done my master's in bachelor.

22:15
 So I just want to know like how we have to get into it without having any experience and maybe this January we'd have to get a first job into IT and land of careers.

22:25
 So in the last movie I was what's was Mission Impossible, Dead reckoning part one.

22:31

22:31

22:35
 Yep.

22:35
 Exactly.

22:36
 So, yeah.

22:36
 Anusha, you said you were having audio issues.

22:38
 So if you had that started.

22:40
 And if you want to.

22:43
 Yes, that's all done.

22:44
 Can you hear me?

22:46
 Yeah.

22:47
 OK.

22:47
 Thank you.

22:47
 Umm, hi, everyone.

22:50
 So my name is Anusha.

22:51
 I'm joining today from Hobart.

22:55
 So I actually am from accounting fields, just looking for a career change and a challenge.

22:59
 So joining this session today and the last movie that I've watched is John Wick Chapter 4.

23:06
 So yeah, that's pretty much well, man.

23:08
 So, yeah, thank you.

23:10
 Really great movie choices.

23:11
 Yeah.

23:13
 So, yeah, Thanks.

23:14
 So yeah, looks like, yeah, we have got a lot of mixed backgrounds and a lot of mixed experience as well and that's that's that's what that's what EE is, right.

23:22
 So no one has exactly same backgrounds and that's that's the reason the the way we built our course is to cater for everyone who comes from different backgrounds and different experiences.

23:33
 So yeah I would like I'd like to take a moment and let Nisa introduce yourself.

23:38
 So Nisa is actually our current student she's currently enrolled in data profession academies course and she actually have a non IT background as well.

23:47
 So some of you might be able to relate to her.

23:49
 She's associates.

23:51
 She has volunteered here to give you an give you an quick outlook of how her experience has been with with us.

24:00
 And yeah, maybe if she wants to share, like any challenges he might have faced, uh, following this journey.

24:07
 So yeah, Nisa, if you're ready.

24:09
 Yeah, take the stage.

24:11
 Hi.

24:12
 Good morning, everyone.

24:13
 Umm, my name is Nisha.

24:17
 Umm, I'm from Nepal.

24:18
 And umm, I'm here in Australia from last four years.

24:23
 So after coming Australia, umm As for our friends reference anything like that, I joined Age Care.

24:31
 I worked there for around three years actually.

24:34
 I completed Bachelors of Business Administration back in Nepal.

24:38
 So it's like I am a non IT background.

24:44
 I know a little bit of database and anything else, but that just collapse itself with my background.

24:51
 So yeah.

24:54
 So after joining aged Care I worked there, but I still felt incomplete and wanted to change in my career.

25:02
 So I I was not finding anything else.

25:04
 But yeah, I got to know Susan from one of my relative over here and we had a quick chit chat and actually he was about to start this Academy within a month of our chit chat.

25:19
 And yeah, I blindly trusted him and his Academy.

25:26
 So I started my dad a career journey from starting his Academy and so far it's been around like almost two months.

25:38
 And yeah, I have been enjoying this a lot.

25:43
 There are a lot of challenges being a non IT background.

25:46
 Even the Excel challenged me or not.

25:49
 I had to ask for a one to one mentoring section with Souza for most of the time, but he was there for me and time and again whenever I needed.

25:59
 So yes, I just can't suggest you the Data Profession Academy.

26:08
 So it's not like a marketing, but it's my experience.

26:12
 So I volunteered to join over here for today.

26:17
 So yeah, we will join this Academy.

26:20
 You will cheer it up and you will break it down.

26:24
 And yeah, I watched the last movie, The Pops Exorcist, 2 days back.

26:31
 So yeah.

26:32
 About exorcism.

26:35
 Thank you.

26:35
 Thanks very much.

26:37
 Yeah, Thanks so much, Nisa, for your kind words.

26:40
 And yeah, Madan, bro, if you're ready, if you want to introduce yourself and yeah, give us some bit more details on like the carrier wise and what what you see in a data career or what we what you have seen in the market as well, that would be great.

26:59
 Hi everyone.

27:00
 Good morning.

27:02
 I'm turning my camera on.

27:04
 OK.

27:05
 Hi everyone.

27:06
 Good morning and namaste, I'm Madan Mani.

27:08
 Adhikari, I'm from Kathmandu, Nepal.

27:13
 OK, I'm also from Nepal and before before joining the Data Profession Academy, I had quite long chat with Suzal.

27:25
 It's it's been like almost two years and even I I asked him to start these data and business analyst job ready program because at that time I was working with another job ready program that's a programming one, software engineering one, and I'm a software engineering graduate in Australia.

27:49
 My background is journalism and mass communication.

27:52
 Back home I used to work in radio, TV and newspapers, even online, OK whenever when I came in Australia in back in 2014, the scenario was quite different to you.

28:07
 If if you came Australia after 15 or 16 then you you probably you got quite good times, good time to start your career, even study even jobs because later later time like 16/17/18 after that like after 19 it's a really comfortable for international students.

28:36
 And the thing after COVID is a lot of international students are holding temporary visa and getting professional job before in back in 2014 fifteen even 16 getting a hired for certificate three this age care job was really big thing.

28:57
 But now after 1819 working in own occupation own field is the main thing in it's the prime thing at this time because only this occupation your job or career that is helping to get settled in Australia in terms of PR or whatever thing.

29:20
 So when I joined, when I joined job ready program is a business development manager is a digital marketer.

29:31
 Then I I did a lot of research on this and I that's why like I I find some interesting thing that's why I'm asks result to move on this one because in our community Nepalese community even I haven't seen that much in Indian or other Asian community for job ready program for the data analyst and business analyst.

29:57
 If you're I have seen in last two to three years I have seen almost more than 50 plus transcripts from different university graduates and lot of lot of going to get their skill assessment in data and business analyst.

30:18
 But there is no such a job ready program for them and it's really hard for them to get get into their career so.

30:33
 So I pushed him actually and he's starting it and you are getting getting in something like someone behind you pushing you to the career.

30:44
 That's the big thing.

30:46
 And this is the one of the top in demand occupation in Australia at this time for data analyst and it's a if you have seen some statistics we shared through our page and community groups, it's the one of the emerging occupation in Australia.

31:08
 Now you can get your skill assessment in data professional or IT professional, professional occupations.

31:15
 But basically there are five, five operations data analysts, data scientists, data engineers, data architects, pricing analysts.

31:25
 They are highly emerging occupation in Australia at this time and due to the COVID and changed scenario in Australian economy, we don't we don't need to have a permanent visa or citizenship to get data analyst job.

31:45
 So it's good for us actually that's the reason why I ask Suzal to go for it.

31:55
 It will help international students, our community members, our friends to get into the occupation and eventually this will help to get PR and other migration related benefits.

32:10
 So we were making decision or we were planning to join this one for you know career change.

32:22
 That's also good.

32:23
 If your your if your degree is going to give you a skill assistant on these occupations, you'll you'll be double benefited actually So.

32:37
 So just learn those skills be focused and be confident you'll get whatever you want that.

32:47
 That's all I want to say at this time.

32:51
 Thank you for listening.

32:52
 Thanks.

32:53
 Thanks.

32:53
 Thanks so much for sharing that.

32:58
 So OK, now that everyone has shared their introduction, let me let me introduce myself a little bit as well.

33:07
 So I will walk you through what my journey has been.

33:09
 And then I I just want to want to share this with you because at the end of the day we we probably share some kind of similarities like so we we were born in a different country.

33:19
 We immigrated to this different land.

33:23
 We had struggles in when when we started and then yeah, we're and some yeah.

33:28
 And we we had like made it through and then now it's our our, our turn to thrive.

33:34
 OK, so I graduated in a in Nepal.

33:38
 So I graduated in 2017 for and I actually don't have like a pure computer engineering background.

33:45
 I actually graduated as an electronics engineer and then after that I moved to Australia and I joined a course called Predictive Analytics and that was purely heavily data focused degree and that's when I switched completely over to data career.

34:00
 But again we we can't expect things to happen like overnight because again you're you're leaving your country you're starting completely new you're you're kind of starting on a clean slate.

34:11
 So it's really hard to get get your first job in Australia.

34:15
 It's not like, OK, you have experience in Nepal like some of you have recently that just shared now that you you would have experience in Nepal or any other countries.

34:25
 But that experience doesn't help you much when you when you come to a different country and that's, that's that's the first struggle or that's the first harder we need to pass, right.

34:36
 So that's, that's what that's what was like one of my biggest struggle.

34:42
 And the only thing that helped me with that was finding my first intensity, OK.

34:48
 Because again, all the other experience weighs less compared to a local experience, OK.

34:55
 So when you get local experience, that's where your career starts and that's one of the reason I have truly focus our course to have to absolutely guarantee an intensive with a local company.

35:08
 Because I know that from my experience, I know that if you don't have that local experience, you will always struggle to land that first job.

35:15
 So this is and again like whether you learn from your experience or whether you learn from someone else's experience, right.

35:22
 So this is my learning from my own experience is that if you don't have an intensive or any other form of local experience, it's really hard to get a job in this market.

35:31
 That's why our job ready program guarantees you the intensive.

35:37
 So yeah, after my first intensive the the careers progression started.

35:41
 So from my intensive I got my first job and yeah, that first job was with my university itself.

35:49
 So it was a part time job, but it was still related to data profession.

35:53
 So I was really happy with that.

35:55
 But again, it's not, it's not always good times because after that the COVID started hitting and then everything was done.

36:03
 But the good thing about these kind of IT jobs is that you can work from home, right?

36:08
 So even when the COVID shut down everything, I was lucky that I secured this position before so that I can I had the comfort of working from home.

36:16
 And that was, that was the really good privilege that I had.

36:20
 OK.

36:22
 And yeah, after that I have been working with a lot of companies.

36:25
 I have worked with the top time mining companies as a consultant.

36:29
 And what what I have found in that journey as well is that even if now it looks easy, but it wasn't easy at that point, right.

36:37
 So a lot of these jobs I have actually applied twice for the same load to get back and that's that that that probably would be something that you can keep in mind as well to OK, don't don't get distracted or don't get disappointed from your rejections.

36:52
 You can make your you can convert your rejections to acceptance if you if you seek feedback, if you try to find out like what went wrong in my previous application and then you learn from that and make your new application better.

37:06
 And then currently I'm a senior dealer engineer at Water Corporation and like like modern money bro last said is that when I joined this company I was still on my temporary visa, so I was on 485 visa but they still offered me prominent role in that.

37:24
 So because because of the job market and because of the growing demand of data analytics and those kind of skills, now the visa requirement is no longer, no no longer a priority.

37:38
 Like they they don't, they don't say like you you need APR or a citizenship for certain roads, you can still apply and get those roads even on a temporary visa.

37:47
 And that's also one of the reason why we why this career can be a really good, a really good place to start for you.

37:55
 OK.

37:56
 And yeah, after that, when I started Data Profession Academy to help out as many people as I can to start their data journey.

38:04
 So this is, this is how my journey has been and hopefully, like, I can help you complete this journey maybe sooner than I did, right?

38:15
 Because when you have help, you can definitely reach the destination sooner.

38:20
 And that's, that's the entire goal of our program.

38:23
 OK.

38:24
 So we talked about like my journey and then everyone gave an introduction.

38:27
 So let's actually talk about the data and then the data career, right.

38:33
 So yeah, data is is like really hot topic these days.

38:37
 Like people, people have been calling like data.

38:39
 It's the new world.

38:40
 Data science is the sexiest job of the century.

38:42
 Data jobs are the job of future.

38:45
 Yeah, it's going to take over all the jobs.

38:46
 Like you can see all these buzzwords coming, right.

38:50
 But no matter what you what we what we hear, one thing is for sure is that the demand for data analysts and data analytics or business analysts is growing day by day because every organization is now trying to push into data-driven strategies and in order to implement those data-driven strategies what do they need?

39:12
 They need data analysts and that's what we're trying to prepare here.

39:15
 Alright.

39:15
 So that's what we're trying to, uh, yeah, train ourselves to become a data analyst so that you can help those businesses drive data-driven decision, OK.

39:26
 And it's not.

39:27
 So previously when we talked about data analysts usually used to think of like big companies like Google, Microsoft, Apple or anything like that.

39:36
 But that's not true anymore.

39:38
 Even small businesses are now using data and analytics to their advantages, right.

39:44
 So from like and and I can't say mining companies are small but mining companies use a lot of analytics and data to to make informed decision and even utilities companies like Water corporation, in Water corporation we have like 50 people analytics team and that's that's that's not so small team right.

40:05
 So all the companies are now focusing and investing so much in data and analytics both in the technology and people as well because technology alone doesn't solve the problem.

40:16
 You need the right people to solve your problem and that's why these career.

40:22
 Is so in demand now and it has got lots of growth potential as well.

40:28
 So when you when you look at data jobs, there are actually different jobs that you will come across.

40:34
 And if you don't know the differences between this, it kind of gets confusing.

40:38
 And then you kind of don't know like OK, what am I actually applying for?

40:41
 Do I apply for this?

40:42
 Do I apply for that?

40:43
 Or if you are trying to learn and then you're also like, OK, what do I, what do I learn or what do I focus my energy on?

40:50
 Because at the end of the day you you have limited time and you cannot learn everything right?

40:56
 So you need to know what to focus on.

40:58
 OK.

40:59
 So if you go out now and look for data related jobs in seek or like any job portal, you will mostly come across three of these different data professions.

41:10
 OK.

41:10
 So the first is data analyst and that's what we will focus our all of the talk today because that's what we will be training you to or that's what our course is designed to help you become.

41:24
 OK.

41:24
 And when I say data analyst, it kind of covers business analyst as well.

41:29
 And even when you see the job advertisement, they will often advertise this job as reporting analyst or or business intelligence analyst and things like that.

41:41
 So the job title will differ.

41:44
 But if you look closely in the responsibility, that's where you can find out, OK, it actually just means the same thing, OK.

41:52
 So the first profession in data is data analyst O Data analysts are responsible for roducing insights from data.

42:00
 OK.

42:01
 And they work with businesses to find out, OK, what are the problems that the business has and then they will use the data to produce some insights that will help them solve that problem, OK.

42:13
 So data analysts are the one that are closest to the business and then they work with business alongside to find, OK, what are the opportunities that we have that we can use our data to make meaningful impact to our business.

42:27
 And that's what that's, that's what data analysts must focus will be and then they build dashboards and reports.

42:33
 So that's their job to build like dashboards and reports.

42:37
 And then the skills that are required for data analysts are Python, SQL, Excel and Power BI.

42:43
 And these are the exact skills that you will learn in our course.

42:46
 OK And we will we will go into into depth of how to become data analysts in our later section and E web.

42:53
 So I'll leave it for now.

42:54
 OK.

42:55
 So that's data analyst.

42:57
 So there are other professions like data engineers.

43:01
 So data engineers are the one who actually curate the data or make the data accessible to the data analyst.

43:10
 OK.

43:10
 And this is the distinction you need to understand as well.

43:13
 Because again, when you're applying for a job application or whether you're trying to long to become a data analyst, you need to learn this distinction and say like, OK, maybe if I'm trying to do this kind of responsibilities like building a data warehouse or maintaining the data warehouse, that's probably not good for what my target job role is.

43:35
 OK, you need to define what your target job role is first.

43:38
 You can't say, OK, I want to become data analyst and data engineer at the same time because it's just too much to learn, right.

43:45
 So you need to focus on one and then say like, OK, I want to be data analyst.

43:49
 Then you need to know what data analyst needs to focus on and maybe leave out the rest because if you try to spread you too broad you won't learn anything, right?

43:59
 So if you if you know, OK, these are the exact voice skills I need to learn, you will learn that better rather than saying OK, I want to learn these ten skills and I want to apply for all the jobs possible.

44:11
 That's not going to happen because when you are learning 1010 skills, you would you would not get into the depth of any of them and that's not good any either, right.

44:21
 So first thing first is you need to understand the difference between these three profession and then you need to pick your side.

44:27
 OK, so you can say that, OK, maybe data analyst is not for me.

44:31
 Data engineering is the thing I want to do and that's fine as well.

44:35
 Then you can focus on the data engineering skill rather than the data analyst skill.

44:39
 OK.

44:40
 So that's why I wanted to give you this introduction of three different professions so that you can pick which one you want to do.

44:48
 And then you also need to define the boundary of, OK, this is something data engineer will do.

44:54
 So I don't need to worry about that as a data analyst.

44:57
 So that's that's that's the whole purpose of me giving you a description of these three data professions.

45:03
 OK, so data engineers are are are responsible for building and maintaining data warehouses, databases and all those things.

45:12
 So they are there to facilitate data analyst and data scientist, OK.

45:17
 That's the major responsibility of data engineer.

45:21
 And then they need a lot of Python And SQL.

45:24
 They need a lot of programming because they need to automate a lot of things.

45:28
 And then they also need a lot of cloud experience because most of the data infrastructure today will be on the cloud.

45:35
 OK.

45:35
 But again, like what?

45:37
 What do we, what do we do that?

45:39
 What do we do with this information?

45:41
 Is that OK?

45:41
 If your goal was to become data analyst, then you don't come into this realm and say, OK, if this is too much about data warehousing, then I can skip that because my goal is not to become a data engineer.

45:53
 My goal is to become a data analyst.

45:56
 OK, and same with the data scientists.

45:58
 So data scientists focus more on like building and training like machine learning models, things like chat, CPT or like computer vision and all those kind of complicated or costume machine learning models in AIS.

46:14
 That's the job of data scientist.

46:16
 OK, so if you want to become data analyst again now you can say OK, I don't need to worry too much about this like convoluted neural network or whatever because I don't want to be data scientist, I want to be data analyst and as a data analyst I need to be more generalistic.

46:32
 OK.

46:32
 So just keep in mind that data analyst is always generalistic.

46:36
 So they have a broader knowledge and they they don't get into the DIFT because if you if they, if they get into the DIF then they'll lose the broader perspective.

46:45
 And the broader perspective is working with business, finding their shortcomings, finding their problem that's that's the major concern of the analyst.

46:55
 OK.

46:56
 So that's that's that's the distinction between free profession and it's really crucial to understand these differences.

47:04
 OK.

47:06
 And next thing is, OK, now if I want to be data analyst, then I need to know how many jobs are out there, right?

47:12
 Because if there are no jobs for data analyst, then why would I become a data analyst?

47:16
 OK, so you can just quickly go to seek or whatever job portal you want to look for, go there and search for data analyst.

47:25
 So you can just do data analyst And in the location I put all Australia, so it's showing data analyst job all across Australia.

47:34
 And you can see at the time I searched there were 10,000 jobs for data analyst and that's purely data analysts.

47:42
 I haven't taken into consideration business analysts or some of them might call it reporting analysts, some of them might call it business intelligence analysts.

47:50
 So there are even more than that.

47:52
 So that's, that's the prospect that's that's the kind of the jobs you will be able to start applying after finishing the course, OK.

48:02
 And next thing, obviously, next obvious thing that comes in mind is, OK, now, now we talked about that that many jobs are available in the market, but how much does it pay?

48:12
 Because if it doesn't pay, well, then, yeah, I don't want to be data endless, right, Because at the end of the day, everyone loves money and everyone actually just works for money.

48:20
 That's, that's the truth.

48:21
 All right.

48:23
 So again, if you just do a quick search on how much does a data analyst make in Australia and you will get a figure like this.

48:32
 OK, So this is, this is actually sourced from talent.com and again it's not it's this doesn't mean that you will get exactly this amount when you start your new job.

48:41
 Obviously when you start with you'll probably start around like 80 K So that's that's kind of like a starting salary of data analysts.

48:48
 It usually starts with 80 K plus and then with like 6 months or even just one year experience, you can easily cross that 6 digit mark, OK.

48:57
 And then after that it's just sky is the limit.

48:59
 So you can, you can ask for as much as you can, depending on your skills.

49:05
 OK.

49:05
 So does this, does this get you excited?

49:13
 Silence.

49:13
 Yeah, it does.

49:15
 As long as you get the job.

49:17
 Yeah.

49:18
 That's.

49:18
 That's the thing, Right.

49:19
 So that leads to another natural question, which is how do I become a data analyst then?

49:25
 Right.

49:25
 Because you.

49:26
 Yeah, we just knew that, OK.

49:27
 There are lots of opportunities.

49:29
 It pays really well as well.

49:31
 So the next natural thing is, yeah, how do I become one?

49:34
 OK, So to become data analysts, we really need to focus on few key things, OK.

49:40
 And those things are first we need to learn basic concepts in data analytics.

49:44
 So big data analytics, like any other, like concept, like if you're talking about marketing or accounting, they do have their own concepts, right?

49:52
 So if you're talking about accounting, it is probably like debit and credit, all those kind of things there.

49:57
 There will be theoretical concepts you need to learn, right?

50:01
 And similarly in data analytics as well, you need to learn some theoretical concepts of what a data is, what information is, how do you, how do you go from data to information and all those kind of theoretical knowledge you need to have this basic concept.

50:13
 So that's step one.

50:15
 Step 2 is you need to learn the tools.

50:18
 OK, because you will be using those tools to do your analysis and what are those tools?

50:23
 OK so those tools are the first thing is the spreadsheet tool like Excel and probably a regime like all of you know what an Excel, what Excel is and that's the primary tool of in data analysts and believe me there are like lots of fancy tool out there but nothing beats Excel.

50:42
 So Excel is the most demand skill for data analyst and we definitely need to master that and we will teach you how to do that as well.

50:51
 And then the second thing is a database query language like Sequel, or if you want to pronounce it like SQL, that's that's the second thing you need to master, because why do we need Sequel is that all the data that you need to analyze will be sitting in some database and then how do you get the data out of that database?

51:11
 You write those SQL queries or the SQL query, right.

51:15
 So that's when you need SQL.

51:17
 And every data analyst is expected to know SQL because otherwise you can't really get the data out of any system.

51:25
 That means how are you going to do the analysis, right?

51:28
 So that's that's a really critical skill for data analyst.

51:33
 And then the third skill is a programming language like Python.

51:37
 OK, and again this can be optional depending on like what kind of data analyst role there is.

51:42
 So sometimes if if your organization is big, then they they can have like different departments and sometimes you can you can be a data analyst without really knowing a programming language.

51:54
 But having a programming language in your skill set is really helpful because with a programming language you're not limited to what you can do.

52:04
 It's it's just your limitation is just your imagination, right?

52:08
 So a programming language lets you do all the things that you want to do.

52:13
 So that's why knowing a programming language is really helpful for data analyst.

52:18
 But again, if you don't know one, that's that's not a blocker.

52:22
 You can still get job in data analyst as a data analyst when you don't know Python.

52:28
 But if you don't know Python, you need to be really good at the other things, right?

52:32
 Because you need to compensate that for something, right?

52:35
 So yeah, it's really good to learn one language, but again, if you don't want that, it's not a blocker as well.

52:42
 You just need to scale yourself up in the others, OK?

52:45
 And then the last one is a dashboarding tool.

52:48
 This is the tool where we build the visualization like reports and bar charts and all those things.

52:54
 And one of the one of the dashboarding tool or the most common, most popular dashboarding tool is Power BI.

53:01
 And that's what we will learn in our course as well.

53:04
 So if you know these four tools and if you're really good with that, that's all you need to become a data analyst, OK.

53:14
 But again, having said that, the job application process is not like not that easy, right?

53:19
 OK, so now you know your concepts, now you know your tools, but still the job application process is daunting.

53:27
 So that's where we need to work on projects to build your portfolio, right.

53:31
 So you need to now show the people or show your potential employer that OK, you are, you are, you haven't just longed the skill, you can actually use the skill to produce something useful.

53:43
 And that's where projects come into play and say, OK, OK, this person has said that they know SQL in their resume, but I don't know if they know or not.

53:53
 So we'll Scroll down in the resume and look at the project section And in the project section, if they mention that, OK, I did this project using SQL to do this, this and this, then I'll be like, yeah, that person definitely knows Sequel.

54:05
 But if they don't put any supporting argument to that skill, even if they put like 10 different skill in there, I'm not going to take it for.

54:14
 I'm not going to take that for granted because people, people tend to lie in the resume and you need some supporting evidence, OK.

54:21
 And if you can't have that supporting evidence, the employer won't going to trust it.

54:26
 And that's why we work on projects and again, projects are part of our course as well.

54:30
 So you will be working on your portfolio projects that goes into your resume and it really supports that that the skills that you have learned, you can actually use those skills to, to build something useful, OK.

54:45
 And then the last one is yeah you definitely apply for the jobs.

54:50
 But again just blankly applying for the jobs is not sufficient.

54:54
 You need to build connections.

54:56
 You need to build networks to increase your chances.

54:59
 And again that's where we come into play.

55:01
 We we provide all the career support that you need.

55:04
 So be it like building your network maybe we'll we'll we'll have like some some of we we can even provide you some of the references in these jobs that you if you need and all those things like in in in just it's like anything that we can help for you to get the job we will do that.

55:26
 OK.

55:27
 So that's, that's on how to become the data analyst.

55:31
 And if you, if you want to go a bit deeper, we, we call it the fore gap strategy, which is like how, how we can help you the best to land your job.

55:43
 OK.

55:44
 And if you look closely between you, between the current you and between the between the job, there are actually 4 gaps.

55:52
 And then if we can fill those gaps and I'm not saying all of us has those four gaps, OK.

55:56
 So some of the, some of us might have the technical skill already, but maybe we're lacking some other points.

56:02
 Some of us might have the soft skills, but we're lacking the technical skills and all those kind of things, right.

56:06
 So what I'm saying is that if we can fill these 4 gaps, we can maximize our chances of getting high, OK.

56:16
 And that's that's what we we want to do again, because when you, when you have a data analyst, you we kind of speak, you tend to speak in numbers, right?

56:24
 So all we're doing is we are trying to maximize our probability of getting hired, right?

56:31
 Because there is no guarantee like no one can get.

56:34
 Even when I'm applying for the job, I can't take my guarantee and then say that I'll be hired 100% because that's not up to me, That's up to the hiring manager.

56:43
 That's up to how I how will I do in the interview.

56:46
 And there are a bunch of other factors that affect whether I will get the job or not.

56:51
 But what I can do from my end is I maximize my chances of getting that.

56:56
 So I will make my resume really good.

56:58
 I will.

56:59
 I will try to build a connection and get to know what the organization is, what the hiring manager is, what their teams look like.

57:06
 I will try to find out everything about them and then I will go in and I will nail that into people.

57:11
 Like I'll just go right on and then just own the rule.

57:15
 But even when I do all that, all I'm doing is I'm maximizing my chances, OK?

57:21
 I'm not, I'm not saying that's 100%.

57:23
 And that's what that's what we're trying to do with these four gaps as well is that we will try to close these four gaps and that will maximize your chances of getting hired.

57:33
 OK.

57:33
 So the first thing is the technical skills and we've already talked about these four.

57:38
 So that is Python, Excel, Power BI and Sequel.

57:42
 And and the reason we pick these four is not out of random, OK.

57:47
 So you can go in today, you go to your job portal, you search for like 10 to 12 or like if you want to go more like go for 20 jobs, 20 data analyst job.

57:57
 Look at the description and just like take a note when you see one of these skills mentioned in that advertisement, OK?

58:05
 And then then you can make a pound of yourself and then say OK.

58:08
 Out of 20 jobs I looked at eighteen of these jobs need any combination of those four.

58:16
 So some of them might need two of them.

58:17
 Some of them might be asking for three of them, but they will definitely ask for any one of them 90% of the time or even 95% of the time.

58:26
 And that's what we're trying to prepare for, right.

58:29
 So when you launch these four skills, you are ready for 95% of the jobs that you see in the job board.

58:37
 And that's, that's what we want, OK.

58:39
 So that's why first thing we focus on will be the technical skills, Second thing is soft skills.

58:48
 And like I said, the data analyst actually needs to work really close with the business.

58:54
 They need to understand the business problem, they need to understand the business requirement.

58:59
 They need to also manage their different stakeholders.

59:03
 And then they they really need good communication scheme as well.

59:06
 Because let's say you're doing an, you're doing some data analysis and you produce this really good insight that could help the business, but your communication skill is really poor, then what what would that do?

59:21
 OK, So what that does is if you if you are not able to communicate properly, then the business outcome won't be delivered, right.

59:30
 So what we need to do is we need to make sure that we we develop our soft skill as well.

59:36
 And this is something that a lot of people often overlook and even if you join like a lot of other training programs, boot camps and whatever, they always focus on technical skills and what happens when you are applying for a job is you, you would probably be just like 40% on your technical scale but 60% on your soft scale right.

59:58
 So even when you're technically sound, you're like so good.

1:00:03
 Do you know why you're not getting hired?

1:00:05
 Because they're looking for something else so and because the data analyst unlike like maybe if we if they are looking for like software developer or programmer with with where the main responsibility is just to code and then produce something.

1:00:20
 That's probably fine, but data analytics is more than that.

1:00:25
 OK, So data analytics is not just crunching numbers and building graphs.

1:00:29
 It's it's more about understanding the problem, solving that problem and then also communicating that issue or communicating that insights back to other people.

1:00:40
 And those other people will actually be like managers or even CEOs of the company.

1:00:46
 And then what will happen is that usually those those people are non-technical people, right?

1:00:52
 So you can't, you can't really give them a lot of technical details and things like that.

1:00:56
 So you need to also learn how to communicate to non-technical audience, right?

1:01:02
 And that's why, because because the data and its job requires all these other aspects as well.

1:01:09
 You really need to focus on the soft skills to in order to maximize your chances of getting hired, OK?

1:01:15
 And again because because we know these four gaps and our course is designed to fill these four gaps, we have a dedicated session or dedicated section where we where we teach those soft skills as well.

1:01:28
 OK.

1:01:31
 And Next up is the job search strategy obviously.

1:01:34
 So we, we we will teach you how to network with people, how to optimize your LinkedIn profile, how to build your killer resume.

1:01:43
 We we also we also will be able to provide you some internal references if there are any available and then all those kind of things that can really help you during the job application process.

1:01:54
 We will do all of that and that also helps bridge this gap with the job search strategy, OK.

1:02:03
 And when the company, when you talk about communication skill in the soft skill path, we talk just about communicating the data insights, right.

1:02:11
 But there is another another aspect as well, which is communicating about your skill or presenting yourself better or like making like selling yourself, right.

1:02:21
 Because what you're doing in your resume, you're trying to sell yourself.

1:02:25
 You have this like 20 years of experience and everything, but you're just trying to sell that in one or two pages of paper and you really need to be really good at in that because this paper is representing you, right.

1:02:41
 And that's what again your communication skills come into play.

1:02:44
 Is that OK?

1:02:45
 How well can you present yourself or how well can you sell yourself?

1:02:49
 Because yeah, that's that's what it is.

1:02:51
 You are literally trying to sell your skills, sell your experience and sell you as a person or sell your personality, right.

1:02:58
 And that's that's where we will try to help you find the best killer resume that helps you get those jobs better.

1:03:06
 Oh, sooner.

1:03:09
 And then the last thing, and this is also most important one is the local experience and being an immigrant, we know this quite a lot than any any other people, right.

1:03:21
 So how do we get those local experience then?

1:03:26
 Because it's kind of like a chicken and egg problem, like you need an experience to get a job and you need a job to get an experience.

1:03:32
 And then there is this never ending loop.

1:03:35
 But we can help you break that by using intensives of volunteering or maybe even some real world projects that will give you the local experience that's needed in order to again maximize your chances of getting the job right.

1:03:53
 So in townships with local companies that's guaranteed.

1:03:56
 With us volunteering, that's something that you can find on your own.

1:04:00
 Or if we do stumble across some volunteering opportunities, we'll definitely let you know and you can contribute to that volunteering aspect as well.

1:04:08
 And when I'm saying volunteering, it's not, it's not like OK going to Red Cross or like doing those things.

1:04:14
 They they are also volunteering.

1:04:15
 They are really they are also appreciated from employers.

1:04:19
 Well volunteering in analytic aspect, right.

1:04:22
 OK, you go on and volunteer to one of the small business and say like I can help you analyze your data beta so that you can maybe make some informed decisions.

1:04:30
 So you go to your like small business or even like if if you know someone who wants a small business, you can go talk to them and say, OK, now I have got this some analytical skills and I can actually volunteer for you to help you find or resolve some issues that you might have in your business.

1:04:46
 And that way it's it's a win win, right.

1:04:49
 So they get some benefit out of your work and you also get the real world exposure that you needed to brace that gap.

1:04:59
 OK.

1:04:59
 So does everything up to this point make sense?

1:05:10
 Yep.

1:05:10
 OK, it's perfect.

1:05:13
 Oh, thanks.

1:05:15
 So while we're Eddie, let me quickly switch my presentation.

1:05:23
 Let's see I can until OK so so we we kind of have already talked about like how we bridge those four gaps but yeah if you if you want to like talk methodically depending on our course as well we use this first step method called lawn use so and do OK.

1:06:19
 So lawn obviously means we learn the skills.

1:06:21
 So we we learn all the skills like learn the basic concepts and tools and then these are the these are the tools and these are the concepts that we learn.

1:06:31
 So I'll I'll quickly go through it because we have already talked about it and you probably don't want to hear me talking about the same thing over and over again.

1:06:40
 So these are the tools that we learn, so we learn the data wrangling.

1:06:44
 So data wrangling means all the process that goes into prepared the data for the analysis.

1:06:50
 So things like data cleaning, data transformation, some exploratory analysis, producing some simple crafts and stuff, that's all we learn in our course.

1:07:00
 OK.

1:07:00
 So yeah, maybe I'm not talking too much technical in here, but don't worry because these are all the things that we learn within the course, OK.

1:07:10
 So we learn data analytics technique, we learn exploratory analysis, all these things are there.

1:07:15
 And then we learn these tools like Excel, SQL, Python And Power BI.

1:07:22
 So after learning the basic we go on to use them and using the skill is actually just building the projects.

1:07:32
 OK, so we once you have learned all the skills, we work together so you you you can come up with some project ideas.

1:07:41
 And again, if you're struggling to get some project ideas, again we can have a chat and then we can discuss about project ideas and then we will help you get that project into completion.

1:07:51
 And when you have that project again, what does that do?

1:07:55
 That makes your resume really good and that just increases of your chances of getting the call.

1:08:02
 So if we talk stepwise in the job application, the first thing is the resume, right?

1:08:07
 So once we get the resume, right, the next thing is you get a call for an interview.

1:08:12
 So first thing is to, OK, how can we make the resume look really good that you get the call.

1:08:18
 And then the next thing that we will do afterwards is, yeah, once you get that call, how do you make, how do we make sure that you nail that interview?

1:08:26
 That's the next step.

1:08:27
 All right.

1:08:29
 So use the skills and all these things that we're doing like building the projects is just to make our resume look really good so that our potential employer will call us for the interview.

1:08:43
 So what kind of projects that we'll do is we will do industry specific real world project and we try to make it as real world as possible.

1:08:53
 So we'll try to find like live data and then we will work on that so that it becomes industry relevant.

1:08:59
 And that's that's also something that just because what what we need to do is we just always need to try to distinguish us from others, right.

1:09:09
 Because imagine that there is a job and like 40 people are applying for that job and what's the only way to get that job is to distinguish you from others, OK.

1:09:19
 And that distinguish needs to be in a good way, like if you're distinguish in a bad way then that that resume just goes to trust, right.

1:09:26
 So we need to distinguish ourselves in a really good way that we stand out from all the applications and then we get that job.

1:09:33
 So doing industry specific, real world project and when I say industry specific, it's kind of depends on what sort of industry you want to target.

1:09:41
 Let's say I'm really into mining and then I want to target for mining companies.

1:09:46
 Then I'll go ahead and do a project that's relative to that's relevant to mining companies or if I'm really interested into banking then I'll just try to do a project that relates to banking.

1:09:59
 And then that would always give me an advantage when I apply for banking job you know like and this position in banks because they will look at the project and then say OK, I kind of know that project or that project is kind of relevant to what we currently do.

1:10:12
 That's what that will help that will help you get noticed from the potential employer.

1:10:17
 And then second thing that that's quite obvious is that don't do what everyone else is doing.

1:10:23
 So if if you're doing the same project like 10 other people, then what good does that do to your resume?

1:10:29
 Because those are the 10 people are also applying for this job, right?

1:10:34
 So you need to make sure that what you do is different from others and not just different.

1:10:39
 It needs to be good from others as well.

1:10:41
 But being different doesn't always mean that you would be good.

1:10:44
 Being different can be bad as well.

1:10:46
 So you also need to make sure that yes, you are different from others, but you are better than them as well.

1:10:52
 And then picking projects based on their interest, that's also something that we help you.

1:10:57
 So we won't come up with like OK, these are the 10 projects or like this is the one project all of you will do because again that would that would come get us to the same problem is that 10% is doing the same project.

1:11:09
 So nothing is different in that case.

1:11:11
 So what we encourage you is we encourage you to find the project based on your interest and we support you get that project to completion.

1:11:21
 And then the other thing is your project needs to be solving a problem.

1:11:24
 Your project can be like, OK, I get this data and then I visualize it.

1:11:28
 Unless you're not solving any problem, your project is not that good.

1:11:35
 And then yeah, after completing this project we need to make sure that the projects are visible.

1:11:39
 So we we need to put it into your GitHub or somewhere online so that you can always show that to your potential resume, potential employer.

1:11:48
 So you can also post it in LinkedIn and saying that, OK, I did this project, I use this, this and this and this project.

1:11:54
 So you need to put yourself out there because people just see what you saw them, right?

1:11:59
 People just don't see what what you are within.

1:12:02
 So you need to make sure that your projects are visible.

1:12:04
 You have a portfolio of projects and then those projects show your skills and that that really helps you in your prospective job application.

1:12:17
 So this isn't using the skills and next literally is showcasing the skills.

1:12:22
 So what we do is so this is this is a really good visual I I I tend to refer to.

1:12:29
 So on the left you can see like you have got so many skills but you have got one you want resume and then you need to use it really wisely to make sure that you have you you showcase all the skills that you have.

1:12:44
 OK.

1:12:44
 So this is your opportunity and you cannot let it win yours at your chance.

1:12:49
 OK.

1:12:50
 So again, this is something we work together on really polishing your resume.

1:12:55
 And then also when you're when you're working on a project, think of how that will show up in your resume as well because at the end what is the purpose of doing a project, The purpose here, Yeah, 11 purpose could be like it's really fun for you, that's fine as well.

1:13:13
 But the main purpose is because this project is going to go on my resume and that will make me stand out from rest of the competition fine.

1:13:22
 So that's something you always need to keep in mind when you are looking for project or even doing the project.

1:13:29
 And then so while you are, while you are building a resume as well.

1:13:34
 And again, this, this, this is just general advice.

1:13:37
 So even though you are not training the course or you're or you're already starting to apply for the job, this is the general advice I give to everyone.

1:13:45
 And this is the question you need to ask when you are when you are about to send your resume to the job.

1:13:51
 OK, so you need to ask yourself the question, why are you the best candidate for this job?

1:13:57
 And if your resume can't answer that, don't send that resume out because it's not going to help.

1:14:05
 OK.

1:14:05
 So if you, if you resume, don't answer that question, tear it up, build another resume and do the same process again.

1:14:15
 And if, if, if, if now the resume can answer this question, then when we send it out, otherwise again, tear it up, go back to the drawing board and do it again.

1:14:25
 Right.

1:14:25
 And that's that's that.

1:14:26
 That has helped a lot.

1:14:28
 And this will definitely help you.

1:14:30
 Yeah, no matter whether you join our course or not, if you are already applying for jobs, follow this strategy and it will definitely help you.

1:14:40
 So the next thing is when you're when you're in job application, you need to beat all the job to get the job.

1:14:48
 So it's not just about being good, it's about being the best.

1:14:53
 Because when there is a job application, they usually open for one person, right?

1:14:57
 They don't, They don't open for like, OK, we need 30 people.

1:15:01
 They'll just say, yeah, we need one dear analyst and everyone is competing for that position.

1:15:06
 So to be the best, you need to beat the rest.

1:15:09
 But having said that, there is an advantage is that there are a lot of these positions, right?

1:15:15
 So 1%, which is really good for one position at late, let's say like an analyst in a bank might not be a good candidate for analysts in, let's say a mining company because the kind of analytics they do is completely different.

1:15:30
 And then the kind of background or business knowledge they need is also different.

1:15:35
 And that could be the advantage that you can use in your application as well.

1:15:40
 So all of you like up to this point in your life, you definitely have something like past experience, you have like different backgrounds and all those kind of things.

1:15:49
 So when you want to become a data analyst, you can actually leverage that skill, right?

1:15:56
 Let's say I, I have worked in retail for like 5 years now.

1:15:59
 I know I have been working as like customer service.

1:16:02
 I've been working as like Casier and all those things and I know a lot about retail.

1:16:07
 Then when I learn this analytical skills, I can now go on and apply for analytical job in retail industry.

1:16:16
 Because if I go as an analyst in retail industry, what I can do is I can use all my past experience from retail and do a really good analytics on that.

1:16:25
 And that's something where you would try to use all of your past experience to give you a better age in this job application, OK.

1:16:33
 And that's that's also something we will try to help you with that we will try to work with what your past experience is and how you can use that past experience to get a better outcome in your job.

1:16:47
 And then obviously we already talked about the communication skills and next thing is the local experience.

1:16:58
 Again, you need job experience to get a job and then you need job to get an experience.

1:17:04
 So we are trying to break this loop with internships, OK.

1:17:11
 So again, we'll probably skip this one as well.

1:17:15
 So it was about the project ideas.

1:17:19
 So that's that's pretty much what I wanted to discuss you about the whole data career what what is prospect looks like and how you can become data analyst today.

1:17:31
 And like I said, I I mentioned those four skills and those four skills are not too technical like probably like all of you already know some sort of Excel and maybe half of you more than half of you would probably have either hard about SQL or SQL or maybe have done some bits and pieces with SQL.

1:17:50
 So again that's really easy to understand that that's like literally it looks like an English syntax and you can easily read that and learn it.

1:17:59
 So it takes no time at all in that Python.

1:18:02
 Again, that's a programming language.

1:18:04
 So you probably would be a bit different.

1:18:06
 Different if you haven't done any programming language in the past.

1:18:09
 But if you have done any programming language in the past, you will probably say that the Python is the easiest thing to learn.

1:18:16
 Because again, it's it's so natural, it's so easy, anyone can pick it up in no time.

1:18:21
 And then the last was Power BI.

1:18:24
 So Power BI is a visualization tool from Microsoft and because it's it's from Microsoft, it's kind of like 80% similar to Excel.

1:18:34
 So once you once you know Excel, you can easily transfer those skills to Power BI.

1:18:40
 Maybe there will be slightly more functionalities in Power BI, but it's really easy to really easy to learn and because it's a visual interface so you will just be like clicking something or like dragging something from somewhere.

1:18:54
 So it's really friendly user interface like Excel and it's really easy to learn as well.

1:19:01
 OK.

1:19:02
 So yeah that's that's that's our entire course.

1:19:05
 And then let me see if I can show you how our.

1:19:13
 OK, so if you go into our website, so this is our website and if you go to courses or you can just Scroll down and go to Data Profession 101 Learn more, then you can see it shows all the outline on what we will study throughout the two velvet.

1:19:35
 So our next session is starting soon and it also talks about like well what makes our course difference and what we focus on that you can definitely see, but you can actually see the course outline and here you can see all all in detail what each week looks like.

1:19:53
 OK.

1:19:53
 Some of them will span across week as well because yeah, they probably take a bit longer than a week to get through.

1:20:01
 But you can see that we talk about Introduction to Data World, we talk about data analytic space shifts and then we move on to the tools like Excel, SQL, Python, Power ZI and then we move on to Data Rangling which talks about data cleaning, data transformation.

1:20:18
 And like I said, we focus on soft skill for data professional as well.

1:20:23
 So that's where we'll talk about.

1:20:25
 So if I use this, so we talk about critical thinkings, we talked about requirement analysis, we talk about project life cycle management and we also talk about problem solving.

1:20:36
 So those are the soft skills we focus on.

1:20:40
 And then again we go back to learning more concepts about data and more concepts on data analytics technique like we give a good brief overview of statistics for data analyst and then we do the data analytics deep dive we see with where we learn about some like AI concepts and ML models.

1:20:59
 It's worth and it's really high level, but yes, it's a really good thing for data analysts to know.

1:21:06
 And then after that we go into data storytelling.

1:21:09
 And that's one of the session that I really like is that once you have produced the insights, you then need to also learn how you can communicate it back to the stakeholder, right.

1:21:21
 And that's why it is called like data analysis is a scale, but data storytelling is an art.

1:21:28
 And then that's where we we we teach you everything about it so that you can clearly and concisely present your insights to the stakeholders and then you can see that there is a mentoring and support.

1:21:42
 So in during anytime in your course if you feel like, OK, I'm struggling a bit and I want one-on-one mentoring.

1:21:50
 This is where we'll come to.

1:21:51
 And then you can anytime you can schedule a 30 minute one-on-one system with me and then talk to me directly and then say that OK, I was doing this Excel and I actually run into this problem and I don't know how to solve it.

1:22:05
 Then I'll be there, I'll sit sit with you for 30 minutes and we will resolve it then and there.

1:22:10
 Or not just that.

1:22:11
 If you have like any other issues or anything like that and you want to talk to me, you can always schedule a session with me.

1:22:18
 And that's, that's one of the best offering we have within the course is that you can always have support when you need it, OK.

1:22:27
 After that we've got the portfolio project.

1:22:30
 Like I said, we'll be working with a pro, working on a project together and then we'll have that as our portfolio project.

1:22:36
 And then last but not the least is our career support.

1:22:40
 And that career support is again available to you always until you land your first job.

1:22:47
 And then yeah, we've got some success stories as well if you want to have a read.

1:22:52
 And yeah they're responsible for the information as well.

1:22:55
 If you want to read about, OK, so this is this is our website.

1:23:02
 You can go in there today.

1:23:03
 You can even sign up for free.

1:23:05
 And when you sign up for free, you can actually access first weeks course without paying anything.

1:23:13
 OK.

1:23:13
 So we have got introduction to Data one, so you can just have a quick look through this reading or learning materials so that you get a flavor of OK, what kind of teaching method we follow and whether that is right for you or not.

1:23:30
 OK.

1:23:30
 So yeah, just feel free to go to dataprofessionacademy.com, have a look at the course outline, and if you want to have a look at those learning resources as well, just do a free sign up and have a look.

1:23:45
 And yeah, feel feel for yourself whether this is right for you or not.

1:23:52
 OK so that's pretty much it on my end.

1:23:58
 Unless if anyone has any question yeah feel free to ask the question Does anyone have any questions spawn.

1:24:22
 No.

1:24:23
 That's a that's a big silence.

1:24:31
 Yeah.

1:24:31
 I I I just I'm just breaking the silence OK what what what staff they student like most of us we are just more progress on the if we build this skill spend spend some some sort of money some sort of time and dedication then we more student is a from as a student like from a student's side like we more concerned with the job do we get the job that's that's the like that's the baseline.

1:25:07
 Baseline is doing that's the thing.

1:25:10
 Yeah I have from the outside is outsider.

1:25:13
 I have seen like couple of students in my my circle they are getting the similar roles on their temporary visa even some some with their student visa or rest with 485 this Grant's a temporary visa.

1:25:31
 So yeah probably student are we like to know more cases and more you know confident view from you you that's the thing yeah so yeah that's and that's that's that's a valid question because yeah when you want to spend some money and spend your time on it the natural question is do we really get the job.

1:25:57
 And on on that, what I would like to say is first, I can take myself as an example.

1:26:03
 So when I got my job, when I got my first full time job, I was actually on a student visa.

1:26:09
 I was not even in a temporary visa.

1:26:11
 OK.

1:26:12
 So I got my full time and that was a permanent position as well.

1:26:15
 So full time permanent position as a data analyst consultant in one of the top mining companies in Australia.

1:26:22
 And I got that while I was on a student visa.

1:26:25
 And then after that I moved to Water Corporation, which is kind of like a government entity.

1:26:30
 And even there I was hired as a permanent data engineer and I was still on 485 which is a temporary visa, but again I wasn't permanent there.

1:26:40
 So from my experience personally, it's like when you got the right skill set and when when when you mask the requirement that they have set it up, then the visa is not an issue.

1:26:51
 And not just me like because I have like lots of my friend who I went to uni together, who who I made through like LinkedIn and all those things they are, they are still getting the jobs.

1:27:02
 They are already in the job market.

1:27:04
 All of my friends which I went to uni with, they're all in the job market now.

1:27:08
 They're they're doing data analytics or related jobs and all of them are in temporary visa.

1:27:13
 I recently got my PR and again also something I wanted to talk about the PR as well is that when you and and I did, I did the course that was IT accredited course.

1:27:27
 Like the ACS accredited course.

1:27:29
 It doesn't even need to be ACS accredited.

1:27:31
 As long as you have been IT major course that should be fine.

1:27:35
 So I had the IT major course and I was doing the job as startup analyst.

1:27:39
 So I was able to do my skill assessment as a developer programmer and that doesn't mean you'd need to do as a developer programmer.

1:27:48
 There are a lot of options like analyst, programmer and now I think that even added more skills to the list.

1:27:53
 So when you're working as a dire and this you can really get your skill assessed on any of the IT field that you want and then once you get your skill assessed then then you can easily get the PR.

1:28:05
 And again I'm I'm one of the example of that.

1:28:09
 So yeah that's that's that's what I would say that yeah I have seen my friends get the job as well and I have got the job as well on a temporary visa.

1:28:16
 So yes it is possible to get the job when you are on a temporary visa and looks like Mapendra has got a hand raise.

1:28:24
 So you have a question.

1:28:27
 My question the so the first question is regarding the internship.

1:28:32
 So I just want to ask you that how do you find the companies for the internship?

1:28:36
 Do you have any partnerships and what approach do you follow for the internship program?

1:28:42
 What I what I can see is in for me the internship will be a main focus because yeah lead skills I can go and learn anywhere and there are a lot sources which can I can and get these skills and I can build my project by myself working on that.

1:28:58
 But this internship it is not possible with any of those.

1:29:02
 So, yeah, please guide me like how would you find the internship and if you have any students currently doing internship also please shed some light on it.

1:29:15
 And yeah and what else.

1:29:18
 And so if you have any project works previously done by your students, we I'll be glad to see those.

1:29:25
 Thank you.

1:29:26
 Yeah, sure.

1:29:27
 Yeah that's that's that's really great question.

1:29:29
 Thanks.

1:29:30
 Thanks for raising that.

1:29:31
 So our internship is with our company partners.

1:29:36
 So we have partnership with certain companies and then we have set up like certain projects that it will do as a part of that company and that's that's that's the way we have set up our intensive relation with our partner companies.

1:29:51
 And other other than that was like if anyone has started the intensive, the answer is no because this is actually our second season.

1:30:00
 Our first season is currently going on is on week 8.

1:30:04
 So they have got few more weeks before they start their internship.

1:30:08
 So their internship has been finalized.

1:30:10
 Like we have already got the agreement with the company but because they haven't completed the course so they haven't actually started their intensive and same with the project is because they haven't completed their studies yet.

1:30:21
 So they will, they will be starting to work on the project soon.

1:30:24
 And then once once they have done that, then yeah, I'll be happy to see this project.

1:30:29
 And we'll actually probably post that in our socials anyway because yeah, there is nothing to hide when when our students are working on their projects, yeah, we'll be happy to share that.

1:30:39
 And when they do start the internship, we will also post that in the socials as well, right?

1:30:45
 So the internship will be on the real problems, right?

1:30:50
 It won't be anything like will be you're working on industry itself.

1:30:54
 IJ, am I correct?

1:30:56
 Yeah, So, so the projects will be real.

1:30:58
 So you will be working on live data that the company has.

1:31:01
 So some of the companies are like software as a service based company.

1:31:04
 So they probably will have data like their customers, their products and all those kind of things.

1:31:08
 So you will be doing analysis on that kind of data.

1:31:14
 Yeah, no worries.

1:31:15
 Thanks for the.

1:31:15
 Thanks for the question.

1:31:22
 Anyone else has any question?

1:31:38
 Yeah, Mira, let's go ahead.

1:31:41
 Yeah.

1:31:41
 So I would like to know, like, how how long is this course for?

1:31:45
 And how many days a week or how many hours a week?

1:31:48
 Like we have to participate.

1:31:51
 Yeah.

1:31:51
 So like like like in the poster, the course is for 12 weeks and we tend to have two live session per week and we're still deciding on the timing and our current session actually runs on the weekend, so Saturday and Sunday.

1:32:09
 But we're hoping whether whether to whether the next session will be completely on weekend or maybe one day will be on the weekday like Monday and then the other session will be on Sunday.

1:32:19
 So yeah, there will be two live sessions.

1:32:21
 Each session will be three to four hours long.

1:32:25
 Sometimes we need like extra hours so we we it can go up to 4 hours someday.

1:32:29
 If the if the concept is really easy and then you you want to leave it early, then it would be the session will be 3 to 4 hours long and then there will be two of those sessions each week for 12 weeks.

1:32:45
 What about the timing like have you decided the timing as well like yeah.

1:32:50
 Yeah.

1:32:50
 So yeah, that's that, that, that's why.

1:32:52
 Like because we are still trying to decide on because a lot of people tend to like when when it's both weekends like Saturday and Sunday, a lot of people struggle to make their time.

1:33:01
 That's why we're trying to see like what could be the best time for like all the attendees and then we're trying to find the best, best time in the day.

1:33:10
 That's why we're we are still, we're still deciding.

1:33:15
 But yeah, most probably it will either be Saturday, Sunday or Sunday and Monday.

1:33:21
 And I think the time that we're hoping for is in the afternoon.

1:33:24
 So if you are, if you are, if you are part best, then you will probably start around like 3:00 PM to 4:00 PM in the afternoon.

1:33:33
 Yeah, sounds good.

1:33:34
 Thank you.

1:33:35
 Yeah, I'm worried.

1:33:45
 OK.

1:33:46
 Any Any more questions?

1:34:04
 Do you still have your hand up or is it from the last time it was OK?

1:34:11
 Yeah, it's on the last time.

1:34:12
 Sorry.

1:34:13
 OK, That's all right.

1:34:14
 So anyone else has any questions of or if you want to just ask the question in the chat as well, if you're not comfortable speaking up, that's fine as well.

1:34:24
 But, and again, if you do want to reach me out, then you can always reach me out at Susal, at dataprofessionacademy.com or just send a message in one of our socials and then we will always try to reach back to you anyway.

1:34:40
 So that's that way you can always reach us out whether in Facebook, LinkedIn or whatever socials you want, you want to find us in.

1:34:54
 OK.

1:34:56
 So if we don't have any Miraj, you have something.

1:35:00
 Yeah.

1:35:01
 Yeah.

1:35:01
 So wouldn't be your next classes like starting next session, starting from, so the next session we're planning for 2nd to 3rd week of December.

1:35:13
 And again like I said, like we, we tend to do a lot of orientation classes and then depending on the interest we we probably like move around the states, but it will be second or third week of December, that's for sure.

1:35:25
 All right.

1:35:27
 Thank you.

1:35:30
 Thanks.

1:35:40
 OK then.

1:35:41
 Yep.

1:35:42
 For you.

1:35:43
 Yeah.

1:35:43
 If you don't have any questions now, but if you want to reach out to us later on, then yeah, there is, there's a phone number.

1:35:50
 You can always contact us directly or like I said, just find us on the social and send us a message.

1:35:55
 All right.

1:35:59
